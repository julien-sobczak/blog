Wrong assumptions, computer bugs, and people caught in between

[This book is about ordinary people caught between bad assumptions and binary logic. You'll read about humans who are invisible go computers, how default password once caused a zombie apocalypse and why airlines sometimes give away free tickets. This is also a book on how to prevent, avoid and reduce the impact of such problems.]

Illustrate common developer errors through memorable, funny, stories. Even if the book concerns quality, it's not a reference book.

Toward less error prone software.

A book that I couldnt stop reading. A collection of stories you will told to your colleagues.

Just incredible. Not just for developers but anyone in our digital world.

What happens when software take decisions with incomplete information, with over simplicity model, when developers ignore leap year and leap seconds, when they take Wrongly assumptions about postal code, when users are forced to enter missing information,

The last part pr√©sent guidelines to avoid cases presented in other parts.

Learning the important of software quality through the consequences of its absence.

A impressive work to retrieve the vast collection of stories.
