This book is the product of a collaboration between two people, a psychological scientist and a science writer. However, the story that it tells is the story of Anders Ericsson, who has spent more than thirty years of his life studying the secrets of extraordinary performers. Numerous best-seller books such as Grit or Outliers lies heavily on his research.

Other books do not emphasize strongly enough the important of deliberate practice over constant effort.

Over the past few years a number of books have argued that people have been overestimating the value of innate talent and underestimating the value of such things as opportunity, motivation, and effort. It helps people know that they can improve a lot with practice, or else they are unlikely to be motivated to even try. But sometimes these books leave the impression that heartfelt desire and hard work alone will lead to improved performance. But this is wrong. The right sort of practice carried out over a sufficient period of time leads to improvement. Nothing else. This book describes in detail what that "right sort of practice" is how it can be put to work.

The first half of this book describes what deliberate practice is, why it works, and how experts apply it to produce their extraordinary abilities. Then, follow a discussion about innate endowment and what role it might play in limiting how far some people can go in attaining expert performance. The last part explains what it means for the rest of us.

The book's focus is mostly on the mental side of expert performance.

To climb a mountain, you could simply take off on whichever path looks promising and hope for the best, but you're probably not going to get very far. The other way is deliberate practice that guarantee that no matter how high you decide to climb, you are doing it in the most efficient, effective way.

This book is your guide and show you the path to the peak. How far you travel along that path is up to you.

Previous books are wonderful at demystifying innate talent but no one comes so close to peak when it comes to explain what to do.

Deliberate practice requires a field that is already reasonably well developed - that is, a field in which the best performers have attained a level of performance that clearly sets them apart from people who are just entering the field. This excludes many of the jobs in today's workplace - business manager, teacher, engineer, and so on. Could programmer be a good candidate to deliberate practice?

First four chapters explains how

Clarify the ten thousand hour of gladwell.

When people assume that talent plays a major, even determining, role in how accomplished a person can become, that assumption points one toward certain decisions and actions. If you assume that people who are not innately gifted are never going to be good at something, then the children who don't excel at something right aways are encouraged to try something else.

The best way to avoid this is to recognize the potential in all of us - and work to find ways to develop it.

Imagine a world in which 50 percent of the doctors, teachers, engineers, programmers, and so one, learn to perform at the level that only the top 5 percent manage today. What would that mean for our health care, our education system, our technology? This book is the first step towards it. With it, you can take charge of your on potential.

The last chapter acting as the conclusion of the book is a wonderful opportunity to look at the potential of deliberate practice in our constantly evolving world and give us the power to take our future into our own hands. Our potential deserves it.

I profoundly thing the world could be very different in a better way if every teacher, engineer, parent, student, doctor, or just everybody, take just a few words to read this life-changing book.
