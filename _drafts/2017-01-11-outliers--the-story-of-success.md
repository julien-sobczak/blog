This is a book about outliers, about men and women who do things that are out of ordinary. The author introduces you to one kind of outlier after another: to geniuses, business tycoons, rock stars, and software programmers. You are going to uncover the secrets of a remarkable lawyer, or why Asians are so good at math. The development argue there is something profoundly wrong with the way we make sense of success.
Author try to convince you that success don't rise from nothing, but from hidden advantages and extraordinary opportunities and cultural legacies that allow you to learn and work hard and make sense of the world in ways others cannot. Where and when we grow up make a difference.

A serious work of journalism
Not very personal.

The 10000 hours number is a debatable interpretation of the research of Anders Ericsson.
Could compl√®tement Grit but certainly not replace it. Different stories.

Famous genius are the products of history and community, of opportunity and legacy. Their success is not exceptional or mysterious. It is grounded in a web of advantages and inheritances. The outlier, in the end, is not an outlier at all.
