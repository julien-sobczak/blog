The secrets of success
Demystify the myth of innate talent.
Fascinating, readable, compelling, and totally persuasive.
The author pulls together decades of psychological research.
If you have a passion for something, Grit will inspire you and help you to stick it.
Challenge our conventional wisdom
One of the most transformative, eye-opening book I've read this year.
Shares the stories, the science, and the positivity behind sustained success.
As clearly illustrated by the author, the grittiness evolve over time and the most gritty person are above 60. With this book, you don't need to wait so long. I recommend particularly this book to every college student. I really would have read the lines 10 years ago. If like me, school is already behind you, do not wait anymore to read this book.
Our Grit changes over time. We often get grittier as we get older.
Personal book. More about top experts than true outliers.
