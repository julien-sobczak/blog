Computer programming has existed as a human endeavor for less than one human lifetime. What make leading programmers so different and what do they have in common. To answer these questions, Peter Seibel visited 15 world-renowned coders at home to interview them. They are the same name that appear when to enter "Programmer" on Google: a majority of language creators (Haskell, JavaScript, Erlang, Smalltalk), but also hackers (Netscape, Ghostscript), researchers (Donald Knuth, Peter Norvig). Most have 30 years of career behind them while some retired early (Bernie Cosell from the ARPANET).

After a few dozens pages, my first reaction was how will I do to get through this unusual book. But after a hundred pages, when I finally get it, I was captivated. The questions are almost always identical: when do they learn to program, what are their most memorable programs, what they've discovered along the way, what is the most difficult bug they have tracked, ... But the answers always reveal something interesting. Each interview brings new insights and this book does a wonderful job of demonstrating that expertise has not a unique path way even if best programmers are the ones that get things done. There are not purists or craftsmanship. Working software is always the goal. That so different from classic literature.  

Of course, interviewed coders does not have the same job than most of us have today. They learn on constrained machines where optimization is required and assembly language a reality. So, most of the content will not be immediately valuable on your daily job but it will have a real impact on the way you think about your career.

I have only one regret with *Coders at Work*: the total absence of code. The interviews give the opportunity to remember past programs, and I would have appreciated some snippets of code to better illustrate keys statements. But considering the vast diversity of languages, the fact of some programs are only in the head of their creators and the book is already 600 pages long, the author probably did a wise choice.  

At the end, rare are the books with so many different perspectives. *Coders at Work* is a first step to understand what are the practices of top performers in our field to help us go further. I recommend this book to the experienced programmer aspiring to learn from his predecessors.
