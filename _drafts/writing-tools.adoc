=== Line Highlighting

The attribute `linenums` is mandatory as the highlighting is done only on line numbers with CodeRay:

[source,javascript,linenums,highlight='2..5']

function slide( h, v ) {
    // Activate and transition to the new slide
    indexh = updateSlides( HORIZONTAL_SLIDES_SELECTOR, h === undefined ? indexh : h );
    indexv = updateSlides( VERTICAL_SLIDES_SELECTOR, v === undefined ? indexv : v );

== Feed

The plugin link:https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll-feed[`jekyll-feed`] imposes the image to be present in the blogpost to be included in the feed. This is problematic as I want to use a standard image for each category.

I use this link:https://markonproduct.com/coding-an-atom-feed-optimized-for-feedly[other solution] as a workaround to really control the `/feed.xml` file content.

. Ask a question. Use a rhetorical device to foster curiosity and gets the reader thinking = active engagement
. Share an anecdote or a quote = Make people laugh or establish the main point of your post.
. Invoke the mind’s eye. Engage the imagination with words like “imagine,” “do you remember when,” etc.
. Use a metaphor. Use the most powerful device to telling a story in a single sentence = allows the reader to tell a story to himself.
. Cite a persuasive statistic. Use truly interesting factoid that the reader just can’t ignore
