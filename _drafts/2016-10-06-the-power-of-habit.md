I will not do a classic book review. What import you the most of what impact the book could have on your daily life. So, I wait several months before writing these words.

The book is filled with passionate real story. Acknowledge that changing habits is possible is the first step before changing its own habits and these stories is the perfect way to make us think.

Various case studies (febrile, toothpaste, Michael Phelps,...

The important role of habits in your personnel life, as a criteria of success for enterprise, and even discuss the habits of societies.

Each chapter relates two or three stories to illustrate it main point. Stories are lengthy described and always interesting. This clearly adds a lot of value to this book.

I presume habits was important but not so much. The book is an eye open book that everyone should read and re-read again regularly.

Contains an appendix to help reader apply the ideas of the book.

The difficult thing about studying habits is that most people, me included, when their hear about this field of research, want to know the secret formula for quickly changing any habit. The problem is that there isn't one formula. There are thousands. Giving up cigarettes is different from how you prioritize tasks at work. So, this book delivers a framework for understanding how habits work and a guide to experimenting with how they might change.

Each chapter explains a different aspect of why habits exist and how they function.

The appendix try to distill, in a very basic way, the tactics that researchers have found for diagnosing and shaping habits within our own lives. A good place to start and paired with deeper lessons from this book, it's a manual for where to go next.

This book convinced me almost habit van be reshaped but change might not be fast or easy. I will not miss to read this book again in a few years. There is so much to learn from it.
