I am fortunate to be a parent. Observing my young son grow is an eye-opening experience. He learns so much and so quickly. He does what he wants. He plays. He has fun. (Almost) All the time. Why did we stop playing and stop having fun? It works so well for children! It can work for us too, and this book will help you escape this boring grown-up trap.

_Be More Kid_ is about what we all do —overthink, procrastinate, care about others' opinions, live in an imaginative future— and how we used to act differently not so long ago.

I found the book excellent even if the key ideas are nothing new. For example, many points focus on the importance of being present, the main topic of any meditation book. This book helps me realize that so many adults are trying to learn what they did naturally as children. Maybe becoming an adult is a failure to fully live.

One thing is certain, if adulthood is synonymous with intellectual maturity, _Be More Kid_ will help you reconsider this definition and appreciate the superpower of the child hidden in you.
