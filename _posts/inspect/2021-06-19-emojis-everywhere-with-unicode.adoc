Unicode is what makes me possible to say hello in more than 100 different languages—እው ሰላም ነው (Amharic), 你好 (Chinese), γεια (Greek), שלום (Hebrew), नमस्ते (Hindi), こんにちは (Japanese), سلام (Persian),  cześć (Polish), Привет (Russian), and Unicode is also what makes you possible to understand the difference in meaning between "You are funny 🤣" and "You are funny 👎." The web would clearly not be the same without Unicode. In this post, I suggest that we are using emojis to learn more about Unicode and how it really works.


[NOTE]
.What You Will Learn
====
* **The Story**
** Why Unicode makes the web possible.
** Why emojis exist in Unicode.
** How you can suggest a new emoji.
* **The Standard**
** What is the Unicode Character Table.
** What is the Unicode Character Database.
** Why UTF-8 is different from Unicode, and why Unicode is different from UTF-8.
* **The Implementation**
** Why "à" == "à" is false in most languages.
** Why the pistol emoji is now a toy.
** How emojis are implemented on your device.

[NOTE]
.Why Learning About Unicode?
====
During my career, I came across the famous link:https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2003/10/08/the-absolute-minimum-every-software-developer-absolutely-positively-must-know-about-unicode-and-character-sets-no-excuses/[Joel Spoky's blog post] about Unicode and character encodings several times. The truth is I still didn't understand what was really Unicode.

As often, if you want to have a good overview of a topic, you have to understand the details. Details create the Big Picture. The reverse is not true. Therefore, I read the Unicode Standard, I read a ton of articles, and I inspected the code of some programming languages and libraries to understand how Unicode works. The result is this article. I hope it will help you better understand the challenges of Unicode, and why developers need to learn more about it.

== The Future

Unicode provides a unique code for every character, in every language, in every program, on every platform. Unicode exists to preserve the world’s heritage.

With link:http://www.unicode.org/education/consortwork.html[approximately 6,000 languages spoken in the world today], there are still many characters and writing systems to encode in Unicode, in addition to the numerous future emojis that make Unicode even more popular.

Unicode is widely suppported by programming languages. But that doesn't mean you can ignore implementation details.


 The Unicode Consortium still needs you to support them and adopting a character can help them achieve their valuable mission.

.To Go Further
====
The scope of Unicode is more vast than simply assigning code points to characters. Unicode give programmers a vast amount of data about the handling of text:

* link:https://www.unicode.org/reports/tr14/[How to divide words and break lines],
* link:http://unicode.org/reports/tr10/[How to sort text],
* link:http://cldr.unicode.org/[How to format numbers, dates, times], and other elements appropriate to different locales,
* link:https://unicode.org/reports/tr9/[How to display text for languages whose written form flows from right to left], such as Arabic or Hebrew,
* link:https://unicode.org/reports/tr36/[How to deal with security concerns] regarding the many look-alike characters from writing systems around the world.
