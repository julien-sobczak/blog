There are lots of Linux users who don't care how the kernel works, but only want to use it. That is a tribute to how good Linux is.

Operating systems were created for developers to communicate with computers without having to speak machine language. Since, operating systems have evolved to run different programs at the same time. As these programs are often written by different developers, the operating system guarantees a correct use of resources so that one program cannot use all the memory or read data written by another program.

Every time your program want to execute a privileged action like printing a text on screen, it requests that the kernel perform the action on its behalf. Your system is like a nursery where the kernel is responsible to ensure all children are playing together, safely.

== Overview

All programs running on Linux use system calls. System calls are the interface between your application and the Linux kernel. If you need one of the services provided by the Kernel, you need a system call. You use them every time you read a file on disk (`open`, `read`, `close`), allocate a new block of memory (`sbrk`, `mmap`), communicate with another processes (`kill`, `listen`), start a new process (`fork`, `wait`), or simply when your program must stop (`exit`).

The command `man 2 syscalls` lists all system calls:

$ apt install manpages-dev
$ man 2 syscalls

This command returns 467 different system calls on my Ubuntu 20.04 server. Not all of them are actively in use. Some system calls are deprecated and only kept to preserve compatibility with old binaries. System calls are unavoidable, but in practice, we don't interact directly with them.

.Library Function vs System Call
****
A library function is simply one of the multitude of functions that constitutes the standard C library.

Many library functions don’t make any use of system calls (e.g., string-manipulation functions like `strcmp()`). On the other hand, some library functions are layered on top of system calls. For example, the `fopen()` library function uses the `open` system call to actually open a file. Often, library functions are designed to provide a more caller-friendly interface than the underlying system call. For example, the `printf()` library function provides output formatting and data buffering, whereas the `write` system call just outputs a block of bytes. Sometimes, library functions and system calls have the same name. For examples, `man 2 exit` prints the manual for the `exit` system call and `man 3 exit` prints the manual for the `exit()` library function.

System calls are implemented by your kernel and are an integral part of Linux. On the contrary, there exists different implementations of the standard C library. The most commonly installed is the GNU C library (link:http://www.gnu.org/software/libc/[glibc]), and is the one we will cover in this article.

****

For example, in C, the PID of your program is accessible using the function `getpid()`:

[source,c]
.getpid.c
----
#include <stdio.h>
#include <sys/types.h>
#include <unistd.h>

int main(void)
{
    pid_t pid;
    pid = getpid(); // <1>
    printf("PID=%d\n", pid);
    return 0;
}
----
<1> The library function `getpid()` is defined in `unistd.h` and returns the PID of the current process using the system call `getpid()`.

Retrieving the PID of the current process is one of the most basic system call. It simply returns the value stored in memory inside a data structure maintained by the kernel. It takes no arguments. It always succeeds. But calling `getpid()` is not like calling any other function.

Here is a minimal benchmark illustrating this difference:

[source,c]
.benchmark.c
----
#include <stdio.h>
#include <sys/types.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <time.h>

pid_t getdummyid() { // <1>
	return 1;
}

int main(void)
{
    pid_t pid;

	clock_t start_time;
    double elapsed_time;

    start_time = clock();
    for (int i=0; i<10000000; i++) { // <2>
        pid = getdummyid();
  	}
    elapsed_time = (double)(clock() - start_time) / CLOCKS_PER_SEC;
  	printf("Done getdummyid in %f seconds\n", elapsed_time);

    start_time = clock();
    for (int i=0; i<10000000; i++) { // <2>
        pid = getpid(); // <3>
  	}
	elapsed_time = (double)(clock() - start_time) / CLOCKS_PER_SEC;
  	printf("Done getpid     in %f seconds\n", elapsed_time);



	return 0;
}
----
<1> We defined a basic function returning an integer literal. Retrieving the PID of a process doesn't interact with a hardware device and simply returning an integer is relatively close to reading this value from a data structure in memory.
<2> We call the two functions 1,000,000 times and measure how long it takes.

Here are the result on my laptop using Ubuntu 20.04 in a virtual server:

[source]
----
# gcc -o benchmark benchmark.c
# ./benchmark
Done getdummyid in 0.022424 seconds
Done getpid     in 4.141334 seconds
----

Calling a system call is, on this example, 200 times slower than calling a simple function. Indeed, a system call is not a simple function call. When you are calling the function `getpid()`, you are using a simple wrapper implemented by glibc that is hiding the logic to execute a system call. Under the hood, this wrapper function, called a library function, does a lot of work:

* *Step 1*: The library function copies its arguments into registers. It also copies a number identifying the system call into a specific register. The library function then force the processor to switch from user mode to kernel mode.
* *Step 2*: The kernel executes the system call:
** The kernel saves the state of the CPU (the register values) onto the kernel stack.
** The kernel checks the validity of the system call number.
** The kernel invokes the right system call routine based on this number. This routine check the validity of arguments and executes the logic of the system call.
** The kernel restores the state of the CPU and places the return value and the possible error in specific registers.
* *Step 3*: The library function checks for an error and set the global variable `errno`. The library returns to the caller.

That's a lot of work. and provides the beginning of an explanation for why system calls are more expensive.


== Step By Step

It's time to show the code behind system calls. We will use glibc (v2.33) and the Linux kernel (v5.13) to illustrate the lines of code running between userland and the kernel. We will continue with the `getpid` example.


=== The Userland (glibc)

==== The Objective

For this first step, the objective is to execute the system call `getpid` from the viewpoint of a user process. Concretely, we will have to specify values in specific CPU registers before calling a specific CPU instruction, and as different CPU architectures have different registers and different instructions set, the logic depends on our computer architecture.

For example, here is the assembly code to execute the `getpid` system call for the `amd64` architecture:

[source,asm]
----
mov rax, 39
syscall
----

Here is the same code for the `arm64` architecture:

[source,asm]
----
mov	r8, 172
svc
----

These two instructions are enough to request the kernel to returns the PID of the current process.

.API vs ABI
****
Linux system calls are accessible using an application binary interface (ABI). An ABI defines how a routine is accessed in machine code (hardware-dependent) whereas an API defines a similar access in source code (hardware-independent).

If Linux system calls where implemented using a standard C API, every program would have to call them as C functions. An ABI removes this restriction by asking the compiler or interpreter of any language to generate the machine code (i.e., initializing the registers). ABI is for hardware what API is for software.

The link:https://wiki.osdev.org/System_V_ABI[System V Application Binary Interface] is the reference specification used by major Unix-like operating systems such as Linux. If we want to understand the previous code sample, we need to have a look in particular at the link:https://refspecs.linuxfoundation.org/elf/x86_64-abi-0.99.pdf[System V Application Binary Interface for AMD64]. This document is 100-pages long but only the section about the calling conventions are interested us:

____
. User-level applications use as integer registers for passing the sequence `%rdi`, `%rsi`, `%rdx`, `%rcx`, `%r8` and `%r9`. The kernel interface uses `%rdi`, `%rsi`, `%rdx`, `%r10`, `%r8` and `%r9`.
. A system-call is done via the `syscall` instruction. This clobbers `%rcx` and `%r11` as well as the `%rax` return value, but other registers are preserved.
. The number of the syscall has to be passed in register `%rax`.
. System-calls are limited to six arguments, no argument is passed directly on the stack.
. Returning from the `syscall`, register `%rax` contains the result of the system-call. A value in the range between -4095 and -1 indicates an error, it is `-errno`.
. Only values of class INTEGER or class MEMORY are passed to the kernel.
____

On our example, we don't have arguments to pass but we still need to specify wihch system call we want to execute. Under the hood, a Linux system call is just a number. For `amd64`, the number 39 represents the `getpid` system call and must be specified in the register `rax` before calling the CPU instruction `syscall`.
****



==== The Code

Glibc implements the library function `getpid()` but also many other functions to make accessible most system calls in a friendly-manner to C programs. Calling the system call `getpid` is not so different from calling other system calls. The number of arguments varies and some calls do not return errors but except that, the logic is pretty similar. Basically, glibc put values in registers and call a specific instruction like `syscall` on `amd64`. Therefore, to avoid code duplication, glibc implements a declarative approach to implement library functions. For example, if you look inside the code source, you will only find the declaration of the function `getpid()`:

[source,c]
.include/unistd.h
----
extern __pid_t __getpid (void);
----

You will not find the implementation directly, at least not in a obvious manner.

System calls are defined in various `syscalls.list` files reflecting the differences between machine architectures. These files are then merged in a precise order and the format looks like this:

[source]
.
----
# File name	Caller	Syscall name	Args	Strong name	Weak names
...
execve  -	execve  i:spp	__execve	execve
flock   -	flock   i:ii	__flock		flock
getpid  - getpid  Ei:   __getpid  getpid
...
----

These files contains the metadata required to generate thin assembly syscall wrappers around the corresponding system calls. For example, `getpid` arguments are defined as `Ei:`, which means:

* `E`: `errno` is not set by the call (i.e., the system call never fails).
* `i`: returns a scalar value (i.e., a integer representing the `pid_t`)
* `:`: separates the return context from the arguments. As there are no letters following the colon, it means the system call takes no argument.

The script `make-syscalls.sh`, launched by the `Makefile` when link:https://stackoverflow.com/a/68153847[building glibc], reads these files to output one rule for every system call:

[source]
.sysd-syscalls
----

unix-syscalls += getpid

                $(..)sysdeps/unix/make-syscalls.sh
        $(make-target-directory)
        (echo '#define SYSCALL_NAME getpid'; \

        ) | $(compile-syscall) $(foreach p,$(patsubst %getpid,%,$(basename $(@F))),$($(p)CPPFLAGS))
endif

The command compiles a C code snippet from `stdin` using a lot of directories containing header files, in particular files named `sysdep.h`. These files declares macros containing the real assembly code for all supported architectures, and like for `sycalls.list` files, there are many occurrences of these files. For example:

[source,c]

To sum up, when we are calling the library function `getpid()`, the alias `__getpid()` is called. This function is implemented in assembly language and execute the same instructions we presented before.

In practice, not all system calls can be generated like this. For example, prior versions of the `getpid()` library function used a cache to limit system calls since the PID of a process never changes. This cache was removed by link:https://repo.or.cz/glibc.git/commit/c579f48edba88380635ab98cb612030e3ed8691e[this commit] but if we move back in Git history, we can have a look at link:https://sourceware.org/glibc/wiki/SyscallWrappers[a different technique] used by glibc to implement library functions.

  return result;

<1> The code checks for the member `pid` in the thread-local memory area to determine if the function has already being called.
<2> If the cache is empty, the code delegates to `really_getpid()` that checks the cache again before calling the macro `INTERNAL_SYSCALL` we have just covered before.

Of course, When a file like `getpid.c` is present, the script `make-syscalls.sh` ensures not to override it:

[source]
.sysd-syscalls
----
#### CALL=getpid NUMBER=39 ARGS=Ei: SOURCE=sysdeps/unix/sysv/linux/getpid.c // <1>
----
<1> No rule is generated for these system calls.

The code will simply be compiled with the rest of the glibc source code, reusing the same macro as the current implementation, which means the code always end up with a call to the `syscall` instruction to give control to the kernel.







=== The Kernel (Linux)


==== The Objective

The user process has just request a service from the kernel. It filled the registers and called a special instruction to jump to a different location. Enter the kernel.

For this second step, the objective is therefore for the kernel to register a procedure to execute at this location. This procedure reads the system call number and looks at the table of system calls to find the address of the kernel function to call. Then after this function returns, it does a few checks and then returns back to the user process.


==== The Code (Linux Kernel)

First, we will have a look at the implementation of the `getpid()` system call.


===== Step 2.1: Implementing a System Call

The main entry point for the `getpid` system call is called `sys_getpid()`, but you would not find the function declaration as such. System call functions are defined using the `SYSCALL_DEFINEn()` macro rather than explicitly, where `n` indicates the number of arguments. This macro takes the system call name followed by the `(type, name)` pairs for the parameters as arguments. The motivation is to make metadata available for other tools like tracing.

Here is the definition of the `getpid` system call :

[source,c]
.kernel/sys.c
----
/**
 * sys_getpid - return the thread group id of the current process
 *
 * Note, despite the name, this returns the tgid not the pid.  The tgid and
 * the pid are identical unless CLONE_THREAD was specified on clone() in
 * which case the tgid is the same in all threads of the same group.
 *
 * This is SMP safe as current->tgid does not change.
 */
SYSCALL_DEFINE0(getpid)
{
	return task_tgid_vnr(current); // <1>
}
----
<1> The code uses the `current` pointer representing the current task, which is the process issuing the syscall. The PID is then extracted from this struct. We will not cover it further.

This entry point also needs a corresponding function prototype in the reference file `include/linux/syscalls.h`. This prototype is marked as `asmlinkage` to match the way that system calls are invoked:

[source,c]
.include/linx/syscalls.h
----
/* kernel/sys.c */
asmlinkage long sys_getpid(void);
----

Finally, the system call must be registered in the system call table, so that the kernel can found it from its number.

Most architectures share a generic system call table:

[source,c]
.include/uapi/asm-generic/unistd.h
----
/* kernel/sys.c */
#define __NR_getpid 172
__SYSCALL(__NR_getpid, sys_getpid)
----

But some architectures (e.g. x86) have their own architecture-specific system call tables. For `amd64`, the system call table looks like:

[source]
.arch/x86/entry/syscalls/syscall_64.tbl
----
#
# 64-bit system call numbers and entry vectors
#
# The format is:
# <number> <abi> <name> <entry point>
...
39	common	getpid			sys_getpid // <1>
...
----
<1> We find again the number 39 representing the `getpid` system call on `amd64`.

That's pretty much all the steps required when link:https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/v4.12/process/adding-syscalls.html[adding a new system call in Linux].

Now, we must look at the glue between the `syscall` CPU instruction and the system call function we have just presented.




===== Step 2.2: Initializing the System Call Entry

On `amd64`, the instruction `syscall` put the address containing in the register `IA32_LSTAR` into the register `RIP`, aka the instruction pointer. After this step, the handler at that location will be executed in a CPU privileged mode. This means that the kernel needs to put the system call entry address into the `IA32_LSTAR` register during its initialization.


.`int 0x80` vs `syscall`
****
Many online code examples use the `int 0x80` instruction instead of `syscall`. This instruction was the only option on `i386` architecture (`x86`) and is still available on `amd64` architecture (`x86-64`) since this latter is a superset of the former for backward-compatibility reasons (i.e., code compiled to `x86` is portable to `x86-64`).

For example, the `getpid` system call can be executed in both ways on `amd64`:

[source,asm]
----
; getpid (x86)
mov eax, 20
int 0x80

; getpid (x86-64)
mov rax, 39
syscall
----

Similar instructions exist for other architectures too. The motivation is always the same——to transition from user to kernel mode in a secure way——an application cannot just jump to arbitrary kernel code.

For an implementation viewpoint:

* `int 0x80` relies on software interrupts. The idea is to use the same method to enter the kernel as hardware interrupts do (ex: when pressing a key on your keyboard).
* `syscall` (and `sysenter`) relies on specific CPU instructions designed for the specific use case of system calls, and thus comes with optimizations.

`syscall` is more performant because it does less operations (`syscall` does not generate a software interrupt) and based on link:https://x86.lol/generic/2019/07/04/kernel-entry.html[some benchmarks], using `syscall` is a magnitude faster (~5 times faster), which is fast compared to `int 0x80` but still slooooow compared to calling a local function.
****


The kernel starts when the function `start_kernel` defined in `init/main.c` is called. This function installs various interrupt handlers using the function `trap_init`, which called `cpu_init`, which called `syscall_init`. Let's look at the implementation of this last function (for `amd64`):

[source,c]
.arch/x86/kernel/cpu/common.c
----
void syscall_init(void)
{
	wrmsr(MSR_STAR, 0, (__USER32_CS << 16) | __KERNEL_CS); // <1>
	wrmsrl(MSR_LSTAR, (unsigned long)entry_SYSCALL_64); // <2>
  ...
}
----
<1> `MSR_*` are link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model-specific_register[Model-specific Register] and can only be written by the privileged CPU instruction `wrmsr`. This first line is low-level code to ensure that we return to user code with the related privilege.
<2> `entry_SYSCALL_64` is the system call entry. We store the address of this function.


Now that system call entry is ready, we are ready too to see what happens when the `syscall` instruction is called, but first, we still have to know more about the system call table.


===== Step 2.3: Initializing the System Calls Table

Any system call will trigger the execution of the system call entry we have just configured. This function determines which system call function to execute by looking into the system call table for the system call number.

This table is represented by the `sys_call_table` array in the Linux kernel:

[source,c]
.arch/x86/entry/syscall_64.c
----
asmlinkage const sys_call_ptr_t sys_call_table[__NR_syscall_max+1] = {
	[0 ... __NR_syscall_max] = &__x64_sys_ni_syscall, // <1>
  #include <asm/syscalls_64.h> // <2>
};
----
<1> All elements points initially to the `sys_ni_syscall` function, which is a fallback function simply returning `-ENOSYS` (`Function not implemented`).
<2> The headerfile `asm/syscalls_64.h` is generated dynamically from the list of system call on your system and override the default handler for all defined system calls for this architecture.

This `asm/syscalls_64.h` file is generated by the script `arch/x86/entry/syscalls/syscalltbl.sh` and the result looks like:

[source,c]
.asm/syscalls_64.h
----
__SYSCALL_COMMON(0, sys_read, sys_read)
__SYSCALL_COMMON(1, sys_write, sys_write)
...
__SYSCALL_COMMON(39, sys_getpid, sys_getpid)
...
----

If we evaluate the macros, our system call table initialization looks like:

[source,c]
----
asmlinkage const sys_call_ptr_t sys_call_table[__NR_syscall_max+1] = {
  [0 ... __NR_syscall_max] = &__x64_sys_ni_syscall,
  [0] = sys_read,
  [1] = sys_write,
  ...
  [39] = sys_getpid,
  ...
};
----

At this point, we have already configured the system call entry and the system call table is ready for this handler to determine the system call to execute. Let's do it.



===== Step 2.4: Entering a System Call

As we seen, the system call entry is defined by the `entry_SYSCALL_64` function defined like this:

[source,c]
----
.code64
.section .entry.text, "ax"

/*
 * 64-bit SYSCALL instruction entry. Up to 6 arguments in registers.

 * available when SYSCALL is used.
 *
 * Registers on entry:

The assembly code is long. The line that interests us is the system call execution:

Where the function `do_syscall_64` is defined like this:

[source,c]
.arch/x86/entry/common.c
----
__visible noinstr void do_syscall_64(unsigned long nr, struct pt_regs *regs)
{
	nr = syscall_enter_from_user_mode(regs, nr);

		nr = array_index_nospec(nr, NR_syscalls); // <2>
		regs->ax = sys_call_table[nr](regs); // <3>
	}
	syscall_exit_to_user_mode(regs);

----
<1> Check the system call number is valid. The value of `NR_syscalls` is determined at compile time.
<2> Clamp the index within `[0..NR_syscalls]`.
<3> Execute the function present in the system call table with the specified number.

After a system call handler returns, the system call entry restores registers, flags and push the return address of the user process before exiting with the `sysretq` instruction. Then, the user program continues exactly where it left off, and we are done with our long journey in Linux system calls.

The code present in this article was tested on Ubuntu 20.04. If like me, you are running on a different operating system, you can recreate the same environment using a local virtual machine. I use link:https://www.vagrantup.com/[Vagrant] on my machine:

----

When using a virtual machine, calling a system call is no different from what we have presented. As the processors are virtual too, the hypervisor is responsible to convert machine code generated for them to the host architecture. link:https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14415050/how-are-system-calls-handled-in-a-virtual-machine/25485159[Several techniques exist] to handle this. A naive approach is for the hypervisor to trap system calls and delegates to the guest OS using different system calls specific to this OS and its architecture.
****

Here is a basic program written in Assembly for `amd64` architecture and executing the system calls `getpid` and `exit`. (The second is required if you don't want your program to crash abruptly at the end.)

[source,asm]
.getpid.asm
----
section .data      ; Section containing initialised data

section .bss       ; Section containing uninitialised data

section .text      ; Section containig code

global _start      ; Linker needs this to find the entry point

_start:
	; getpid
	mov rax, 0x27
	syscall

	; exit
	mov eax, 60
	xor edi, edi
	syscall
----


What we have is still a text file with assembly language instructions. This isn’t a format that a computer can run. Assembly language instructions is text (source code) that must be converted into bytes (machine code). Therefore, we need to run a few commands:

* `nasm`: The assembler "assembles" the instructions to machine code bytes to create an object file.
* `ld`: The linker turns this object file into an executable file that the operating system can run. (As we have only one object file, the linker does almost nothing but is a mandatary step.)

image::compilation.png[]

Let's create the executable:

[source]
----
$ nasm -f elf64 -g -F dwarf getpid.asm
$ ld -o getpid getpid.o
$ ./getpid
----

The program outputs nothing. We haven't write code for that. We can solve this problem using a debugguer to inspect registers but first, let's dump some information about our object file:

[source]
----
$ objdump -d getpid

getpid:     file format elf64-x86-64

Disassembly of section .text:

0000000000401000 <_start>:
  401000:	b8 27 00 00 00       	mov    $0x27,%eax
  401005:	0f 05                	syscall
  401007:	b8 3c 00 00 00       	mov    $0x3c,%eax
  40100c:	31 ff                	xor    %edi,%edi
  40100e:	0f 05                	syscall
----

The result of the `getpid` system call will be available starting with the address `401007` in the register `rax`.

[source]
----
# gdb getpid
Reading symbols from getpid...
----

Let's output some information about our file:

[source]
----
(gdb) info files
Symbols from "/home/vagrant/getpid".
Local exec file:
	`/home/vagrant/getpid', file type elf64-x86-64.
	Entry point: 0x401000 // <1>
	0x0000000000401000 - 0x0000000000401010 is .text
----
<1> We retrieve the intial address `0x401000` as reported previously by the command `objdump`.

Let's add a breakpoint to stop after the system call execution:

[source]
----
(gdb) break *0x401007
Breakpoint 1 at 0x401007: file getpid.asm, line 15.
(gdb) run
Starting program: /home/vagrant/getpid

Breakpoint 1, _start () at getpid.asm:15
15		mov eax,60
----

Print the value of the register `rax`:

[source]
----
(gdb) info register rax
rax            0xfdb               4066
----

In a second terminal:

[source]
----
# ps fauxww | grep getpid
root        4064  0.1  2.2  36168 22884 pts/0    S+   07:03   0:00  |                       \_ gdb getpid
root        4066  0.0  0.0    156    16 pts/0    t    07:04   0:00  |                           \_ /home/vagrant/getpid
----

This confirms that the PID of our program is `4066`. We successfully executed our first system call using assembly code!







== Case Studies

=== Go

We will use Go for this case study and explain by showing code how Go make system calls accessible to Go developers. We will still use the `getpid` system call as example.

The function `Getpid` is implemented by the package `os`:

[source,go]
.src/os/exec.go
----
package os

import (
	"syscall"
)

func Getpid() int { return syscall.Getpid() }
----

The code simply delegates to the package `syscall`. This package contains files implementing system calls for every supported architecture. For example, the file `zsyscall_linux_amd64` provides the implementation for system calls for the `amd64` architecture. Other files such as `zsyscall_linux_arm64` exists in the same package. Go build constraints are used to determine which file is finally used when building the binary:

[source.go]
.src/syscall/zsycall_linux_amd64.go
----
//go:build linux && amd64
// +build linux,amd64
----

Here is the definition of `Getpid` for `amd64` architecture:

[source,go]
.src/syscall/zsycall_linux_amd64.go
----
// THIS FILE IS GENERATED BY THE COMMAND AT THE TOP; DO NOT EDIT

func Getpid() (pid int) {
	r0, _ := rawSyscallNoError(SYS_GETPID, 0, 0, 0)
	pid = int(r0)
	return
}
----

As visible from the code, this file was generated from the template file `syscall_linux_amd64.go` using the utility program link:https://github.com/golang/go/blob/go1.16.6/src/syscall/mksyscall.pl[`mksyscall.pl`] present in the same package. Here is a snippet from the template file:

[source,go]
----
.src/syscall/syscall_linux.go
//sysnb	Getpid() (pid int)
----

This prototype definition of the system call `getpid()` defines the number of arguments, if errors can be returned, and also if the current goroutine must be suspended during the execution of the system call (`sys` vs `sysnb` = suspend or not).

What remains to cover is the code behind this line:

[source,go]
----
r0, _ := rawSyscallNoError(SYS_GETPID, 0, 0, 0)
----


This function `rawSyscallNoError` is defined like this:

[source,go]
.src/syscall/syscall_linux.go
----
package syscall

func rawSyscallNoError(trap, a1, a2, a3 uintptr) (r1, r2 uintptr)
----

In Go, a function declaration may omit the body. Such a declaration provides the signature for a function implemented outside Go, such as an assembly routine.

The code belongs in the link:https://godoc.org/golang.org/x/sys/unix[`sys/unix` package], providing access to the raw system call interface of the Linux underlying operating system. Porting Go to a new architecture/OS combination or adding syscalls requires changes centralized in this project. For example, the hand-written assembly files at `asm_${GOOS}_${GOARCH}.s` implement system
call dispatch, which are parsed by the Go tooling to build the final code.

Here is the native implementation for Linux of the function `rawSyscallNoError`:

[source,asm]
.src/cmd/vendor/golang.org/x/sys/unix/asm_linux_amd64.s
----
TEXT ·RawSyscallNoError(SB),NOSPLIT,$0-48
	MOVQ	a1+8(FP), DI
	MOVQ	a2+16(FP), SI
	MOVQ	a3+24(FP), DX
	MOVQ	$0, R10
	MOVQ	$0, R8
	MOVQ	$0, R9
	MOVQ	trap+0(FP), AX	// syscall entry
	SYSCALL
	MOVQ	AX, r1+32(FP)
	MOVQ	DX, r2+40(FP)
	RET
----

NOTE: The code logic should look familiar if you recall the calling conventions retrieved from the System V ABI specification.

Concerning the `getpid` system call, the const `SYS_GETPID` is defined like this:

[source,go]
.src/cmd/vendor/golang.org/x/sys/unix/zsysnum_linux_amd64.go
----
SYS_GETPID                 = 39
----

And now, the native implementation of the system call `getpid`:

[source,asm]
.src/runtime/sys_linux_amd64.s
----
#define SYS_getpid		39

TEXT ·getpid(SB),NOSPLIT,$0-8
	MOVL	$SYS_getpid, AX
	SYSCALL
	MOVQ	AX, ret+0(FP)
	RET
----

For comparison, here is the same code for the `arm64` architecture:

[source]
.src/runtime/sys_linux_arm64.s
----
#define SYS_getpid		172

TEXT ·getpid(SB),NOSPLIT|NOFRAME,$0-8
	MOVD	$SYS_getpid, R8
	SVC
	MOVD	R0, ret+0(FP)
	RET
----


That's all. You have reviewed the official Go code to execute a system call on Linux. The kernel code that really performs the action is still unchanged from what we covered in step 2.



=== Java

Since Java 9, the process API can be used to get the current process ID.

First you grab a handle to the current process, then query the PID:

[source,java]
----
long pid = ProcessHandle.current().pid();
----

This method is implemented in the type link:https://github.com/openjdk/jdk/blob/jdk-16+36/src/java.base/share/classes/java/lang/ProcessHandleImpl.java[`ProcessHandlerImpl`] like this:

[source,java]
.java/lang/ProcessHandleImpl.java
----
package java.lang;

/**
 * ProcessHandleImpl is the implementation of ProcessHandle.
 *
 * @see Process
 * @since 9
 */
@jdk.internal.ValueBased
final class ProcessHandleImpl implements ProcessHandle {

    static {
        long pid = getCurrentPid0();
    }

    /**
     * The pid of this ProcessHandle.
     */
    private final long pid;

    /**
     * Returns the native process ID.
     * A {@code long} is used to be able to fit the system specific binary values
     * for the process.
     *
     * @return the native process ID
     */
    @Override
    public long pid() {
        return pid;
    }

    /**
     * Return the pid of the current process.
     *
     * @return the pid of the  current process
     */
    private static native long getCurrentPid0();
}
----

The code delegates to the `native` function `getCurrentPid0` implemented in C in link:https://github.com/openjdk/jdk/blob/jdk-16+36/src/java.base/unix/native/libjava/ProcessHandleImpl_unix.c[`ProcessHandleImpl_unix.c`]:

[source,c]

}
----
<1> The link:https://linux.die.net/man/3/getpid[function `getpid()`] is defined by glibc.

We are back to our initial coverage of the library Glibc. It's time to close this blog post.

== `mov eax, 60`

As we have seen through this article, a system call is definitively not a simple function call. A lot of code is executed to delegate the responsability to the kernel so that it can ensure we are privileged to execute it.

System calls are important for developers. They define the capabilities of your system. For example, the link:https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/epoll.7.html[`epoll` system call] helped link:https://www.nginx.com/[Nginx] to solve the link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C10k_problem[C10k problem] by offering a event-driven I/O model, the link:https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/inotify_init.2.html[`inotify_*` system calls] allows link:https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/blob/v4.0.0/docusaurus/docs/troubleshooting.md#npm-start-fail-due-to-watch-error[`react-scripts`] to automatically rerun your tests when you are making a code change, the link:https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/sendfile.2.html[`sendfile` system call] supports the link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-copy[Zero-Copy] optimization used by link:https://kafka.apache.org/08/documentation.html[Kafka], which is one of the main reasons explaining its performance, the link:https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/ptrace.2.html[`ptrace` system call] is link:https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/6933/how-does-a-debugger-work-in-linux/375257[used by debugguers] like gdb to inspect your program using breakpoints, and so on. The question is thus, what are you going build using these system calls? 😉



.To Remember
****
* *System calls are doors to enter the kernel*. There is a security guard that must check your identity before executing your action. This could not be as fast as staying in the same room and executing the action yourself.
* *System calls are dependent on your architecture*. The ABI defines which registers and which instructions must be used on your architecture.
* *System calls are accessible in the standard library of your programming language*. But as modern languages are often implemented in their own language, they cannot interact directly with registers and must implement workarounds like rewritting the logic in assembly and relying on the compiler to merge it with the rest of the compiled code.
* *System calls are often implemented in a generic way*. Glibc lists most system calls in `syscalls.list` and uses build tools to actually generate the source files. Similar toolings exist in Go and inside the Linux kernel.
