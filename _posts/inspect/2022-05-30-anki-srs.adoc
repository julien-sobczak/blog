[quote, Hermann Ebbinghaus, German Psychologist having introduced the Forgetting Curve]
____
Humans more easily remember or learn items when they are studied a few times over a long period of time (spaced presentation), rather than studied repeatedly in a short period of time.

[NOTE]
.Prerequisites
====
I consider that you have already used Anki. All code examples uses the Python language, mainly Anki was implemented only in Python until recently, and also because it's a great language for novice programmers. You don't need to have a solid understanding of the language to follow the article. The code uses basic Python syntax.

== SRS Primer

The role of any Spaced Repetition System (SRS) algorithm is basically to determine what the user should review now, or say differently, when must happen the next review for every answered item. The goal os any implementation will always to prevent the effect of the forgetting curve:

image::forgetting-curve.png[width=750]

As soon as we learn or review a piece of knowledge, the decay begins. SRS algorithms needs to determine the optimal interval between two reviews to ensure we have not completely forgotten it (memory retention = 0%) while trying to limit as much as possible the number of reviews. In practice, most algorithms uses 10% for the forgetting index (= 90% of items are remembered correctly) so that we don't have too many items to review again while keeping the number of reviews close to optimal. The detail of the different algorithms differ greatly between the various systems. We will review the most popular ones before introducing Anki's solution.


=== The Leitner System (1970s)

If link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermann_Ebbinghaus[Hermann Ebbinghaus[] is credited for the initial research behind SRS, the link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leitner_system[Leiter System] is often quoted as the first algorithm. This system uses a physical box as outlined by the following illustration:

image::Leitner-original.png[width=550]

Here is a small Python program implementing the logic behind the original Leitner system:

[source,python]
----
from queue import Queue
import random

CARDS_PER_CM = 5

BOX = [
    Queue(1  * CARDS_PER_CM),
    Queue(2  * CARDS_PER_CM),
    Queue(5  * CARDS_PER_CM),
    Queue(8  * CARDS_PER_CM),
    Queue(14 * CARDS_PER_CM),
]

def add(card, i):
    BOX[i].put(card)
    if BOX[i].full():
        study()

def review(card):
    return random.choice([True, True, True, False])

def study():
    for index, partition in enumerate(BOX):
        if partition.full():
            # Time to review the cards
            print(f"Time to study partition {index + 1}!")

            cards_to_review = []
            while not partition.empty():
                cards_to_review.append(partition.get())

            for card in cards_to_review:
                answer = review(card)
                new_index = None
                if answer and index + 1 < len(BOX):
                    # Promote
                    new_index = index + 1
                elif not answer and index - 1 > 0:
                    # Demote
                    new_index = 0
                else:
                    # Replace in the same partition
                    new_index = index
                add(card, new_index)

if __name__ == "__main__":

    # Populate the box
    for i in range(140):
        add("New Card", 0)

    # Study
    study()
----

An alternative method using three boxes where incorrect answers are only moved back to the previous box is often privileged:

Here is a program implementing this new logic:

[source,python]
----
from queue import Queue
import random
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

A = 0
B = 1
C = 2
SYSTEM = [
    Queue(), # Box A: every day
    Queue(), # Box B: every 2-3 days (ex: Tuesday & Friday)
    Queue(), # Box C: every week (ex: Sunday)
]


def add(card, i):
    """Add a new card in the Leitner system."""
    SYSTEM[i].put(card)

def review(card):
    """Answer a single card."""
    return random.choice([True, True, True, False])

def study_box(number):
    """Review all cards in a box."""
    cards_to_review = []
    while not SYSTEM[number].empty():
        cards_to_review.append(SYSTEM[number].get())

    for card in cards_to_review:
        answer = review(card)
        new_number = None
        if answer and number < C:
            # Promote
            new_number = number + 1
        elif not answer and number > A:
            # Demote
            new_number = number - 1
        else:
            # Replace in the same box
            new_number = number
        add(card, new_number)

def study(day):
    """Study the box according the week day."""
    weekday = day.weekday()
    if weekday == 0: # Monday
        study_box(A)
    elif weekday == 1: # Tuesday
        study_box(A)
        study_box(B)
    elif weekday == 2: # Wednesday
        study_box(A)
    elif weekday == 3: # Thursday

    # Study (over 10 days)
    for i in range(10):
        day = datetime.today() - timedelta(days=10 - i)
        study(day)

=== SM-0 (1985)

Algorithms are precise instructions to carry out. As we have seen with the Leitner system, algorithms don't have to be executed on computers at all.footnote:[You can easily reproduce manually what a computer does, except you will take so much more time.] The first version of the SuperMemo Algorithm was thought to be executed manually too. The link:http://super-memory.com/articles/paper.htm[SM-0 algorithm] (aka the paper-and-pencil SuperMemo method) was published in 1985 and relies on link:http://super-memory.com/articles/paper.htm[paper books filled with tables].

image::sm-0.png[width=800]

Altough the algorithm was designed to be carry out manually, we can still capture the logic using code:

[source,python]
----
import random
from datetime import date, timedelta
from queue import Queue

# The table of repetition intervals determines the number of days between
# two successive reviews.
# SM-0 applies the factor 1.7 behind two successive values.
# The first value is fixed at 4 days.
TABLE_REPETITION_INTERVALS = [4] # First review after 4 days
# Use the factor 1.7 to determine next intervals
# Ex: 4, 7, 12, 20, ...
for i in range(1, 15): # 15 repetitions ~=
    prev = TABLE_REPETITION_INTERVALS[i - 1]
    next = int(prev * 1.7)
    TABLE_REPETITION_INTERVALS.append(next)

# The book containing the pages to review
DATABOOK = []
# The book containing the pages to review day after day
# NB: We uses a spare dictionary where only dates
# with one or more pages to review are present
SCHEDULE_BOOK = {} # <date, [page numbers]>

# Fake the user in answering the question
def review_question(question, repetitions):
    """
    Randomly answer a question.
    The chance of answer correctly increases with the number of repetitions.

    return random.choice([True] * repetitions * 4 + [False])

class Page:

    def __init__(self, questions, answers):

        # "Repetitions" column
        self.repetitions = []

    def review(self):
        remaining_questions = Queue(self.questions)

        # Review until there is no more cards wrongly answered
        iteration = 1
        # Memorize the number of wrong answers during the first iteration
        U = 0
        while not remaining_questions.empty():

            questions_to_review = []
            while not remaining_questions.empty():
                questions_to_review.append(remaining_questions.get())

            for question in questions_to_review:
                if not review_question(question, iteration):
                    # Review again
                    remaining_questions.append(question)
                    if iteration == 1:
                        U += 1
            iteration += 1

        self.repetitions.append({
            "No": len(self.repetitions) + 1,
            "Dat": str(date.today()),
            "U": U,
        })


if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Add a new page for illustration purposes
    DATABOOK.append(Page(
        questions=["Question 1", "Question 2", "Question 3"],
        answers=["Answer 1", "Answer 2", "Answer 3"],
    ))
    page_number = len(DATABOOK) - 1

    # Mark the page to review according the table of repetition intervals
    now = date.today()
    for interval in TABLE_REPETITION_INTERVALS:
        review_date = str(now + timedelta(days=interval))
        if review_date not in SCHEDULE_BOOK:

        SCHEDULE_BOOK[review_date] = [page_number]

        day = str(now + timedelta(days=i))
        if not day in SCHEDULE_BOOK:
            # Nothing to review today
            continue

        for page in SCHEDULE_BOOK[day]:
            print(f"Reviewing page {page} on {day}")
            DATABOOK[page].review()
----

The SM-0 algorithms can be challenging in practice for different reasons:

* **All items in a given page are reviewed at the same time**. For hard-to-remember items (items that require more than 3 reviews on a given day to be recalled), SM-0 recommends to duplicate them on a new page in your book. These items will be reviewed more frequently, and some will maybe be duplicated again if still to hard to remember.
* **The intervals are determined using an estimation of the average case** (x1.7) but the ideal intervals depend on the complexibility and of your familiarity with the subject. You probably needs shorted intervals for science subjects like Mathematics for example. The intervals are determined using the factor 1.7 (4 days, 4 * 1.7 ~= 7 days, 7 * 1.7 ~= 12 days, 20 days, 1 month, ...). In most cases, intervals should increase 1.5—2.0 times after each repetition. A factor lower than 1.4 or larger than 3 are, almost always, a bad idea.
* Last but not least, executing the algorithm manually works, but is far from being a smooth learning experience...

Enter the computer.


=== SM-2 (1987)

Unlike physical systems where cards are grouped in the same box/partition/page and are reviewed collectively, digital systems consider each item separately. For example, the SuperMemo algorithm called link:https://www.supermemo.com/en/archives1990-2015/english/ol/sm2[SM-2] assigns a specific level of difficulty to every card and determines the appropriate intervals between repetitions using this specific value.

image::sm-2.png[width=800]

Now, the same logic but implemented as code:

[source,python]
----
import random
from datetime import date, timedelta
from queue import Queue

def grade(question, repetitions):
    # Increase the chance of success with the increased number of repetitions
    choices = [0] * 1 * repetitions + [1] * 2 * repetitions + \
              [2] * 3 * repetitions + [3] * 4 * repetitions + \
              [4] * 5 * repetitions + [5] * 6 * repetitions
    return random.choice(choices)

# Settings
I1 = 1
I2 = 6
MIN_EF = 1.3

class Item:

    def __init__(self, question, answer):
        self.question = question
        self.answer = answer
        self.EF = 2.5
        self.I = I1
        self.next_review = date.today() + timedelta(days=self.I)
        self.repetitions = 0

    def review(self, day, q):
        self.EF = max(self.EF+(0.1-(5-q)*(0.08+(5-q)*0.02)), MIN_EF)
        if q < 3:
            self.I = I1
        elif self.I == I1:
            self.I = I2
        else:
            self.I = round(self.I * self.EF)
        self.next_review = day + timedelta(days=self.I)
        self.repetitions += 1
        return q < 4

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Populate items
    items = []
    for i in range(1, 100):
        items.append(Item(f"Q{i}", f"A{i}"))

    # Review one year
    # for i in range(365):
    for i in range(365):
        day = date.today() + timedelta(days=i)

        items_to_review = Queue()
        for item in items:
            if item.next_review == day:

            if not item.review(day, q):
                items_to_review.put(item)

The SM-2 algorithm remains popular even today as you will discover in the rest of this article.


== Anki Algorithm

From link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anki_(software)[Wikipedia]:

[quote,Wikipedia]
____
"The SM-2 algorithm, created for SuperMemo in the late 1980s, forms the basis of the spaced repetition methods employed in the program. Anki's implementation of the algorithm has been modified to allow priorities on cards and to show flashcards in order of their urgency.
____


Anki source code includes different version of its SRS algorithm (called a _Scheduler_). All got inspiration from SM-2. The link:https://faqs.ankiweb.net/the-anki-2.1-scheduler.html[V2] is currently in use since 2018 even if the link:https://faqs.ankiweb.net/the-2021-scheduler.html[V3] is the target. In practice, for the purpose of this article, we can ignore the details between these different versions. You can find the source code for the different versions on GitHub if you are interested: [v1.py](https://github.com/ankitects/anki/blob/2.1.49/pylib/anki/scheduler/v1.py), [v2.py](https://github.com/ankitects/anki/blob/2.1.49/pylib/anki/scheduler/v2.py), [v3](https://github.com/ankitects/anki/blob/2.1.49/pylib/anki/scheduler/v3).


In this blog post, we will analyze the V2.1 scheduler as it is the version I'm famliar with. We will use the [version 2.10.0](https://github.com/ankitects/anki/blob/2.1.10/anki/schedv2.py) of Anki Desktop to ignore recent refactorings (rewrite of backend code in Rust, introduction of Protocol Buffer messages, factorization of common code among scheduler versions using inheritance, etc.). This will help us keep the code easy to grasp.

Here is a recall of link:https://docs.ankiweb.net/getting-started.html#key-concepts[Anki terminology]:

image::anki-terminology.png[width=750]

As outlined by the schema, we will focus on the core abstractions (Collection, Note, Card) that affects how the SRS algorithm really works. In addition, cards in Anki are scheduled differently depending their state:

image::anki-workflow.png[width=700]

Here is an overview of the Anki algorithm:

image::anki-srs.png[width=750]


### Part 1: Settings

Unlike previous systems, Anki is highly configurable. Not all settings affect the SRS algorithm. Here are the default setting values used by Anki that will be used:

[source,python]
----

# Whether new cards should be mixed with reviews, or shown first or last
NEW_CARDS_DISTRIBUTE = 0
NEW_CARDS_LAST = 1
NEW_CARDS_FIRST = 2

# The initial factor when card get promoted
STARTING_FACTOR = 2500

# Default collection configuration
colConf = {
    'newSpread': NEW_CARDS_DISTRIBUTE,
    'collapseTime': 1200, # <1>
}

# Default deck configuration
deckConf = {
    'new': { # <2>
        'delays': [1, 10],
        'ints': [1, 4],
        'initialFactor': STARTING_FACTOR,
        'perDay': 20,
    },
    'rev': { # <2>
        'perDay': 200,
        'ease4': 1.3,
        'maxIvl': 36500,
        'hardFactor': 1.2,
    },
    'lapse': { # <3>
        'delays': [10],
        'mult': 0,
        'minInt': 1,
        'leechFails': 8,
    },
}
----
<1> If there is no more card to review now but next card in learning is in less than `collapseTime` seconds, show it now. +
  _Setting_: `Preferences` > `Basic` > `Learn ahead limit` * 60 (default: `20` minutes)
<2> The settings differs based on the queue where a card belongs. For example, when learning (`new`) cards, the delays is increased by graduating steps whereas the delay is multplied by a given factor for review (`rev`) cards. The meaning of individual setting will become clearer when we will detail the formula.
<3> When you forget a review card, it is said to have 'lapsed', and the card must be relearnt. The default behaviour for lapsed reviews is to reset the interval (`minInt`) to 1 (i.e. make it due tomorrow), and put it in the learning queue for a refresher (`delays`) in 10 minutes.


* `new`
** `delays`: The list of successive delays between the learning steps of the new cards. The first delay will be used when you press the `Again` button on a new card, and is 1 minute by default. The `Good` button will advance to the next step, which is 10 minutes by default. Once all steps have been passed, the card will become a review card, and will appear on a different day. +
  _Setting_: `Preferences` > `New Cards` > `Learning steps` (Default: `1m 10m`)
** `ints`: The list of delays according to the button pressed while leaving the learning mode after pressing "Good" or "Easy." +
  _Setting_: `Preferences` > `New Cards` > `Graduating interval`/`Easy interval` (Default: `1` and `4`)
** `initialFactor`: The ease multiplier new cards start with. By default, the `Good` button on a newly-learned card will delay the next review by 2.5x the previous delay. +
  _Setting_: `Preferences` > `Advanced` > `Starting ease` (Default: `2.50`),
** `perDay`: The maximum number of new cards to introduce in a day, if new cards are available. +
  _Setting_: `Preferences` > `Daily Limits` > `New cards/day` (Default: `20`)

* `rev`
** `perDay`: The maximum number of review cards to show in a day, if cards are ready for review. +
  _Setting_: `Preferences` > `Daily Limits` > `Maximum reviews/day` (Default: `50`)
** `ease4`: An extra multiplier that is applied to a review card's interval when you rate it `Easy`. +
  _Setting_: `Preferences` > `Advanced` > `Easy bonus` (Default: `1.30`)
** `maxIvl`: The maximum number of days a review card will wait. When reviews have reached the limit, `Hard`, `Good` and `Easy` will all give the same delay. +
  _Setting_: `Preferences` > `Advanced` > `Maximum interval` (Default: `36500`)
** `hardFactor`: The multiplier applied to a review interval when answering `Hard`. +
  _Setting_: `Preferences` > `Advanced` > `Hard interval` (Default: `1.20`)

* `lapse`
** `delays`: The list of successive delays between the learning steps of lapsed cards. By default, pressing the `Again` button on a review card will show it again 10 minutes later. +
  _Setting_: `Preferences` > `Lapses` > `Relearning steps` (Default: `10m`)
** `minInt`: The minimum interval given to a review card after answering `Again`. +
  _Setting_: `Preferences` > `Lapses` > `Minimum interval` (Default: `1`)
** `mult`: The multiplier applied to a review interval when answering `Again`. +
  _Setting_: `Preferences` > `Advanced` > `New interval` (Default: `0`)
** `leechFails`: The number of times `Again` needs to be pressed on a review card before it is marked as a leech. +
  _Setting_: `Preferences` > `Lapses` > Leech threshold (Default: `8`)


### Part 2: Model

Let's begin with the model. Anki stores cards in a SQLite database. In this tutorial, we will mimic the same model but we will store the cards directly in-memory inside the collection object. We will also ignore decks completely as they mostly allow to review different cards using different settings or at different times but don't really change how Anki works.

        # The number of times the card went from a "was answered correctly"
        # to "was answered incorrectly" state.
        self.lapses = 0
        # Of the form a*1000+b, with:
        #   a => the number of reps left today
        #   b => the number of reps left till graduation
        # Ex: '2004' = 2 reps left today and 4 reps till graduation
        self.left = 0
        # Due is used differently for different card types:
        # - new => note id or random int
        # - lrn => integer timestamp in second
        # - rev => integer day, relative to the collection's creation time
        self.due = self.id
----
<1> The `Scheduler` implementation will be the main topic of the remaining of this section.
<2> The identifiers are initialized using a helper function `intId()` which uses the current time and ensures two successive calls return different values. Here is the definition:

[source,python]
----
import time

def intId():
    """Returns a unique integer identifier."""
    t = intTime(1000)
    # Make sure the next call to the function returns a different value
    while intTime(1000) == t:
        time.sleep(1)
    return t

def intTime(scale=1):
    "The time in integer seconds. Pass scale=1000 to get milliseconds."
    return int(time.time()*scale)
----

The `Scheduler` is the largest class that we will cover. A scheduler in Anki is an object supporting two methods:

* `getCard()`: Returns the next card to review
* `answerCard(card, ease)`: Updates the card after an answer (`ease`: `0` for "Again", `1` for "Hard", `2` for "Good", and `3` for "Easy")

[source,python]
----
class Scheduler:

    def __init__(self, col):
        # The collection used to retrieve the cards
        self.col = col
        # An upper limit for new and review cards
        self.queueLimit = 50
        # # An upper limit for learning cards
        self.reportLimit = 1000
        # The number of already reviewed cards today.
        self.reps = 0
        # The number of days since the collection creation.
        self.today = self._daysSinceCreation() # <1>
        # The timestamp of the end of day
        self.dayCutoff = self._dayCutoff() # <2>
        # The timestamp in seconds to determine the learn ahead limit.
        self._lrnCutoff = 0 # <3>
        self.reset()
----
<1> The attribute `today` represents the number of days since the collection creation. It is used when searching for review cards where the attribute `due` represents the number of days relative to the collection's creation time. The value is initialized like this:
+
[source,python]
----
class Scheduler:

    def _daysSinceCreation(self):
        startDate = datetime.datetime.fromtimestamp(self.col.crt)
        return int((time.time() - time.mktime(startDate.timetuple())) // 86400)
        # Note: 86400s = 1d
----
<2> The attribute `dayCutoff` represents the timestamp of the beginning of the next day. Anki allows to customize at which hour a days is ending. Here, we simply use midnight:
+
[source,python]
----
class Scheduler:

    def _dayCutoff(self):
        date = datetime.datetime.today()
        date = date.replace(hour=0, minute=0, second=0, microsecond=0)
        if date < datetime.datetime.today():
            date = date + datetime.timedelta(days=1)
        stamp = int(time.mktime(date.timetuple()))
        return stamp
----
<3> The attribute `_lrnCutoff` is related to the setting `collapseTime` (also called the learn ahead limit). The method `_updateLrnCutoff` is used to initialize it and update it:
+
[source,python]
----
class Scheduler:

    def _updateLrnCutoff(self, force):
        nextCutoff = intTime() + self.col.colConf['collapseTime']
        if nextCutoff - self._lrnCutoff > 60 or force:
            self._lrnCutoff = nextCutoff
            return True
        return False
----


### Part 3: Queues Management

The method `reset()` present in the last line of the `Scheduler`'s constructor initializes the queues managed by Anki:

[source,python]
----
class Scheduler:

    def reset(self):
        self._resetLrn()
        self._resetRev()
        self._resetNew()

    # New cards
    #################################################################

    def _resetNew(self):
        self._newQueue = [] # <1>
        self._updateNewCardRatio() # <2>

    def _fillNew(self):
        if self._newQueue:
            return True
        lim = min(self.queueLimit, deckConf["new"]["perDay"])
        self._newQueue = list(filter(lambda card: card.queue == 0,
            self.col.cards)) # <3>
        self._newQueue.sort(key=lambda card: card.due)
        self._newQueue = self._newQueue[:lim]
        if self._newQueue:
            return True

    def _updateNewCardRatio(self):
        if colConf['newSpread'] == NEW_CARDS_DISTRIBUTE:
            if self._newQueue:
                newCount = len(self._newQueue)
                revCount = len(self._revQueue)
                self.newCardModulus = (
                    (newCount + revCount) // newCount)
                # if there are cards to review, ensure modulo >= 2
                if revCount:
                    self.newCardModulus = max(2, self.newCardModulus)
                return
        self.newCardModulus = 0 # = Do not distribute new cards


    # Learning cards
    #################################################################

    def _resetLrn(self):
        self._updateLrnCutoff(force=True)
        self._lrnQueue = [] # <1>

    def _fillLrn(self):
        if self._lrnQueue:
            return True
        cutoff = intTime() + colConf['collapseTime']
        self._lrnQueue = list(filter(lambda card: card.queue == 1 and
            card.due < cutoff, self.col.cards)) # <4>
        self._lrnQueue.sort(key=lambda card: card.id)
        self._lrnQueue = self._lrnQueue[:self.reportLimit]
        return self._lrnQueue

    # Review cards
    #################################################################

    def _resetRev(self):
        self._revQueue = [] # <1>

    def _fillRev(self):
        if self._revQueue:
            return True
        lim = min(self.queueLimit, self.col.deckConf["rev"]["perDay"])
        self._revQueue = list(filter(lambda card: card.queue == 2 and
            card.due <= self.today, self.col.cards)) # <5>
        self._revQueue.sort(key=lambda card: card.due)
        self._revQueue = self._revQueue[:lim]

        if self._revQueue:
            r = random.Random()
            r.seed(self.today)
            r.shuffle(self._revQueue)
            return True

----
<1> By default, the queues are empty. Anki defers their filling until a card is retrieved.
<2> The method `_updateNewCardRatio()` determines the frequency for new cards (only when new cards are spreaded among other cards). For example, if there are 50 review cards and 10 new cards, the ratio will be 5 so that a new card is returned after every 5 review cards. The attribute `reps` present in `Scheduler` keeps the current number of reviewed cards for the current study session and will be useful in complement to this ratio `_newCardModulus` to determine if the next card must be a new card or a revie card.
<3> Anki searches for all cards in the queue `0` (= new) and sort them by due date before returning the first N cards based on the current daily limit.
<4> Anki searches for all cards in the queue `1` (= lrn) that are due and sort them by timestamp as the id is initialized from the creation timestamp
<5> Anki searches for all cards in the queue `2` (= rev) that are due and sort them by the due date before returning the first N shuffled cards based on the current daily limit.


The logic to initialize the queues is ready but will be executed in the next step when retrieving a card to study.

### Part 4: Card Retrieving

The main method is the method `getCard`.

[source,python]
----
class Scheduler:

    def getCard(self):
        card = self._getCard()
        if card:
            self.reps += 1
            return card
----

This method delegates to `_getCard()` and simply increases the counter of studied cards except when the study session is completed.

[source,python]
----
class Scheduler:

    def _getCard(self): # <1>
        "Return the next due card, or None."

        # learning card due?
        c = self._getLrnCard()
        if c:
            return c

        # new first, or time for one?
        if self._timeForNewCard():
            c = self._getNewCard()
            if c:
                return c

        # card due for review?
        c = self._getRevCard()
        if c:
            return c

        # new cards left?
        c = self._getNewCard()
        if c:
            return c

        # collapse or finish
        return self._getLrnCard(collapse=True)


    # New cards
    ##########################################################################

    def _getNewCard(self):
        if self._fillNew(): # <2>
            return self._newQueue.pop()

    def _timeForNewCard(self):
        "True if it's time to display a new card when distributing."
        if not self._newQueue:
            return False
        if colConf['newSpread'] == NEW_CARDS_LAST:
            return False
        elif colConf['newSpread'] == NEW_CARDS_FIRST:
            return True
        elif self.newCardModulus:
            return self.reps and self.reps % self.newCardModulus == 0


    # Learning queues
    ##########################################################################

    def _getLrnCard(self, collapse=False):
        if self._fillLrn(): # <2>
            return self._lrnQueue.pop()

    # Reviews
    ##########################################################################

    def _getRevCard(self):
        if self._fillRev(): # <2>
            return self._revQueue.pop()
----
<1> By default, Anki shows cards in a well-defined order:
+
. (optional) New cards if the setting `newSpread` is configured with `NEW_CARDS_FIRST`.
. Learning cards that are due
. (optional) New cards if the setting `newSpread` is configured with `NEW_CARDS_DISTRIBUTE` (the default) if the ratio allow it.
. Review cards
. (optional) New cards if the setting `newSpread` is configured with `NEW_CARDS_LAST`.
+ The logic for new cards is implemented in the method `_timeForNewCard()`.
<2> The methods `_fillXXX()` returns `True` when the queue is not empty, in which case, we simply have to pop an element from the queue.


The queues are now initialized when retrieving the first card in each of them. This works great for the current session but when a new day begins, Anki must reinitialize the queues because other cards may have reached their due date.

[source,python,linenums,highlight='4,9-14,16-19,22']
----
class Scheduler:

    def reset(self):
        self._updateCutoff() # <1>
        self._resetLrn()
        self._resetRev()
        self._resetNew()

    def _updateCutoff(self):
        # days since col created
        self.today = self._daysSinceCreation()
        # end of day cutoff
        self.dayCutoff = self._dayCutoff()
        return stamp

    def _checkDay(self):
        # check if the day has rolled over
        if time.time() > self.dayCutoff:
            self.reset()

    def getCard(self):
        self._checkDay() # <2>
        card = self._getCard()
        if card:
            self.reps += 1
            return card

----
<1> The method `_updateCutoff()` is called every time the queues are reset (= once a day). When this happens, it means a new day have started and therefore the day limit must be refreshed too.
<2> The method `_checkDay()` is called every time we retrieve a new card to study. This way, if we have passed the current day, the queue will be reset before returning the card.



### Part 5: Card Updating

Now that we have a method to empty the list of cards to study, we will turn our attention on the core part of the SRS algorithm. Every time we study a card, the card must be rescheduled to be studied again. Basically, we need to update the attribute `due` of the card but the logic varies according the current state (ex: the current queue, ease factor, and interval).

[source,python]
----
class Scheduler:

    def answerCard(self, card, ease):
        assert 1 <= ease <= 4
        assert 0 <= card.queue <= 4

        card.reps += 1

        if card.queue == 0:
            self._answerNewCard(card, ease)
        elif card.queue in [1, 3]:
            self._answerLrnCard(card, ease)
        elif card.queue == 2:
            self._answerRevCard(card, ease)
        else:
            assert 0
----

We will detail each case separately.

### Part 5.1: Answering New Cards

[source,python]
----
class Scheduler:

    def _answerNewCard(self, card, ease):
        # came from the new queue, move to learning
        card.queue = 1 # <1>
        card.type = 1 # <2>
        # init reps to graduation
        card.left = self._startingLeft(card) # <3>

    def _startingLeft(self, card):
        conf = self._lrnConf(card)
        tot = len(conf['delays'])
        tod = self._leftToday(conf['delays'], tot)
        return tot + tod*1000

    def _leftToday(self, delays, left, now=None):
        "The number of steps that can be completed by the day cutoff."
        if not now:
            now = intTime()
        delays = delays[-left:]
        ok = 0
        for i in range(len(delays)):
            now += delays[i]*60
            if now > self.dayCutoff:
                break
            ok = i
        return ok+1
----
<1> Anki simply updates the attribute `queue` to move a card to a different queue. When the destination queue will be reset (ex: for tomorrow session), the card will be automatically inserted into it.
<2> The attribute `type` is similar to the attribute `queue` (they share the same values `0`, `1`, `2`, and `3`). In practice, the attributes `queue` and `type` may differs for example after a lapse. When pressing "Again," on a review card, the card will be moved back to the learning back (`queue = 1`) but the type will be unchanged (`type = 3`) to remember the card was previously a review card. This will be useful when graduating the card back to the review queue after relearning.
<3> The attribute `left` is particular. The numeric format keeps two information: how many times the card will be reviewed today, and how many steps before graduation. The methods `_startingLeft` and `_leftToday` implement this logic. You can safely ignore the details.


So, when answering a new card, the card is automatically promoted to the learning queue.

### Part 5.2: Answering Learning Cards

[source,python]
----
class Scheduler:

    def _answerLrnCard(self, card, ease):
        conf = self._lrnConf(card) # <1>

        # immediate graduate?
        if ease == 4:
            self._rescheduleAsRev(card, conf, True)
        # next step?
        elif ease == 3:
            # graduation time?
            if (card.left%1000)-1 <= 0:
                self._rescheduleAsRev(card, conf, False)
            else:
                self._moveToNextStep(card, conf)
        elif ease == 2:
            self._repeatStep(card, conf)
        else:
            # back to first step
            self._moveToFirstStep(card, conf)

    def _lrnConf(self, card):
        if card.type == 2:
            return self.col.deckConf["lapse"]
        else:
            return self.col.deckConf["new"]
----
<1> The settings to apply differs according if the card comes from the review or new queue. For example, the steps are different after a lapse than when learning a new card for the first time.

We will detail what happens depending which button was pressed when answering the card.

* After pressing "Again"...

[source,python]
----
self._moveToFirstStep(card, conf)
----

The card is moved back to the first step:

[source,python]
----
class Scheduler:

    def _moveToFirstStep(self, card, conf):
        card.left = self._startingLeft(card) # <1>

        # relearning card?
        if card.type == 3:
            self._updateRevIvlOnFail(card, conf) # <2>

        return self._rescheduleLrnCard(card, conf) # <3>

    def _updateRevIvlOnFail(self, card, conf):
        card.ivl = self._lapseIvl(card, conf)

    def _lapseIvl(self, card, conf):
        ivl = max(1, conf['minInt'], int(card.ivl*conf['mult']))
        return ivl

    def _rescheduleLrnCard(self, card, conf, delay=None):
        # normal delay for the current step?
        if delay is None:
            delay = self._delayForGrade(conf, card.left)

        card.due = int(time.time() + delay)
        card.queue = 1
        return delay

    def _delayForGrade(self, conf, left): # <4>
        left = left % 1000
        delay = conf['delays'][-left]
        return delay*60
----
<1> We restore the attribute `left` as if the card were a new card.
<2> We process lapses differently. By default, we reset the attribute `ivl` to `1` (next review in one day).
<3> The card due date is determined by adding the next step to the current date. The card remains in the learning queue (`1`).
<4> The method `_delayForGrade()` is a helper method to get the next step interval. The method extracts the number of remaining steps from the attribute `left` (Ex: `1002` => 2 remaining steps) and use the setting `delay` to find the matching delay (Ex: `1m 10m 1d` => next study in `10m`).


* After pressing "Hard"...

[source,python]
----
self._repeatStep(card, conf)
----

The current card step is repeated. This means the attribute `left` is unchanged. We still have the same number of remaining steps before graduation. The difference is that the card will be rescheduled in a delay slighy longer than the previous one. We average the last and next delays (Ex: `1m 10m 20m` and we are at the step 2 => repeat in `15m`).

[source,python]
----
class Scheduler:

    def _repeatStep(self, card, conf):
        delay = self._delayForRepeatingGrade(conf, card.left)
        self._rescheduleLrnCard(card, conf, delay=delay) # <1>

    def _delayForRepeatingGrade(self, conf, left):
        # halfway between last and next
        delay1 = self._delayForGrade(conf, left)
        delay2 = self._delayForGrade(conf, left-1)
        avg = (delay1+max(delay1, delay2))//2
        return avg
----
<1> We reuse the method `_rescheduleLrnCard` introduced just before to update the card's due date.


* After pressing "Good"...

[source,python]
----
# graduation time?
if (card.left%1000)-1 <= 0:
    self._rescheduleAsRev(card, conf, False)
else:
    self._moveToNextStep(card, conf)
----

The decision depends on if there are remaining steps or not:

* If we have finished the last step, the card is graduated to the learning queue:
+
[source,python]
----
class Scheduler:

    def _rescheduleAsRev(self, card, conf, early):
        lapse = card.type in (2,3)

        if lapse:
            self._rescheduleGraduatingLapse(card) # <1>
        else:
            self._rescheduleNew(card, conf, early) # <2>

    def _rescheduleGraduatingLapse(self, card):
        card.due = self.today+card.ivl
        card.type = card.queue = 2

    def _rescheduleNew(self, card, conf, early):
        card.ivl = self._graduatingIvl(card, conf, early)
        card.due = self.today+card.ivl
        card.factor = conf['initialFactor']
        card.type = card.queue = 2

    def _graduatingIvl(self, card, conf, early):
        if card.type in (2,3):
            return card.ivl
        if not early: # <3>
            # graduate
            ideal =  conf['ints'][0]
        else:
            # early remove
            ideal = conf['ints'][1]
        return ideal
----
<1> When a lapse is graduated, we add the the previous interval to the current date to determine the due date.
<2> When a new card is graduated, we must initialize the two key attributes relative to the SRS algorithm: the ease factor and the interval. These fields will be reused to determine the next due date for review cards.
<3> When graduating a new card, the initial interval will be different according if we are completed all steps ("Good") or if we have press ("Esay") to immediately graduate the card (1 vs 4 days by default).

* If there are still remaining steps:
+
[source,python]
----
class Scheduler:

    def _moveToNextStep(self, card, conf):
        # decrement real left count and recalculate left today
        left = (card.left % 1000) - 1
        card.left = self._leftToday(conf['delays'], left)*1000 + left # <1>

        self._rescheduleLrnCard(card, conf)
----
<1> The attribute `left` is updated to decrement the number of remaining steps and to recalculate the number of studies until the next day.

* After pressing "Easy"...

[source,python]
----
self._rescheduleAsRev(card, conf, True)
----

The card is graduated to the learning queue as when we complete every step. The only exception if the initial interval will be larger as explained in the previous point.

The card will be rescheduled in an "ideal" number of days. When using Anki, most cards resides in the learning queues and the "Again" button is pressed rarely. The core logic of the Anki SRS algorithm is present in the following methods.

A more complete annotated version is also available in the link:https://github.com/julien-sobczak/anki-srs-under-the-hood/blob/main/anki/schedv2_annotated.py[same repository] including two additional features described next.



=== Bonus: Day Boundaries

link:See https://docs.ankiweb.net/deck-options.html?#day-boundaries[Anki treats small steps and steps that cross a day boundary differently]. With small steps, the cards are shown as soon as the delay has passed, in preference to other waiting cards like reviews. This is done so that you can answer the card as closely to your requested delay as possible. In contrast, if the interval crosses a day boundary, it is automatically converted to days.

The code splits the learning queue in the above code into two distinct queues: sub-day learning and day learning.

[source,python]
----
# ...

def _resetLrn(self):
    self._lrnQueue = []
    self._lrnDayQueue = [] # <1>

# ...

def _rescheduleLrnCard(self, card, conf, delay=None):
    # normal delay for the current step?
    if delay is None:
        delay = self._delayForGrade(conf, card.left)

    card.due = int(time.time() + delay)
    # due today?
    if card.due < self.dayCutoff: # <2>
        card.queue = 1
    else:
        # the card is due in one or more days, so we need to use the
        # day learn queue
        ahead = ((card.due - self.dayCutoff) // 86400) + 1
        card.due = self.today + ahead
        card.queue = 3

# ...

def _getCard(self):
    # learning card due?
    c = self._getLrnCard() # <3>
    if c:
        return c

    # new first, or time for one?
    if self._timeForNewCard():
        c = self._getNewCard()
        if c:
            return c

    # card due for review?
    c = self._getRevCard()
    if c:
        return c

    # day learning card due?
    c = self._getLrnDayCard() # <3>
    if c:
        return c

    # new cards left?
    c = self._getNewCard()
    if c:
        return c

    # collapse or finish
    return self._getLrnCard(collapse=True)
----
<1> The previous queue is split into two queues:
* `_lrnQueue` (`queue == 1`) = sub-day learning queue
* `_lrnDayQueue` (`queue == 3`) = day learning queue

<2> Learning cards are rescheduled in the sub-day queue `1` when the next review is planned before the end of the day review session. The due date is the number of seconds until the next review. Otherwise, the card is rescheduled in the day learning queue `3` and the delay is the number of days until the next review.

<3> Sub-day learning cards are prioritized first to be sure to review them as close as their delay in seconds. Day learning cards are reviewed last since their delay in days tolerate more flexibility (reviewing them the next day is not as bad as for sub-day learning cards).


=== Bonus: Fuzzing

When you select an ease button on a review card, link:https://docs.ankiweb.net/studying.html#fuzz-factor[Anki also applies a small amount of random “fuzz”] to prevent cards that were introduced at the same time and given the same ratings from sticking together and always coming up for review on the same day.

Here is the code:

[source,python]
----
def _fuzzedIvl(self, ivl): # <1>
    min, max = self._fuzzIvlRange(ivl)
    return random.randint(min, max)

def _fuzzIvlRange(self, ivl):
    if ivl < 2:
        return [1, 1]
    elif ivl == 2:
        return [2, 3]
    elif ivl < 7: # <2>
        fuzz = int(ivl*0.25)
    elif ivl < 30: # <2>
        fuzz = max(2, int(ivl*0.15))
    else: # <2>
        fuzz = max(4, int(ivl*0.05))
    # fuzz at least a day
    fuzz = max(fuzz, 1)
    return [ivl-fuzz, ivl+fuzz]
----
<1> The function `_fuzzedIvl` is only called for interval greater than one day. For sub-day learning cards introduced in the previous point, fuzzing is also applied up to 5 minutes:
+
[source,python]
----
maxExtrax = min(300, int(delay*0.25))
fuzz = random.randrange(0, maxExtra)
----
<2> The fuzzing increases the greater the interval even if the fuzz factor is reduces since the interval becomes larger.





== A Better Anki SRS Algorithm?

The link:http://www.supermemo.com/english/ol/sm2.htm[SM-2 algorithm], on which Anki is based, was released in 1987 in SuperMemo 1.0. It was revised several times since: +
link:http://super-memory.com/english/ol/sm4.htm[SM-4] (1989),
link:http://super-memory.com/english/ol/sm5.htm[SM-5] (1989),
link:http://super-memory.com/english/ol/sm6.htm[SM-6] (1991),
link:http://super-memory.com/english/algsm8.htm[SM-8] (1995),
link:http://super-memory.com/english/algsm11.htm[SM-11] (2002),
link:http://super-memory.com/english/algsm15.htm[SM-15] (2011),
link:https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Algorithm_SM-17[SM-17] (2015),
link:https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Algorithm_SM-18[SM-18] (2019). Each version iterate over deficiencies of the previous one.
You can find a link:https://supermemo.guru/wiki/History_of_SuperMemo_algorithm[short summary] of the main changes brings by each algorithm version or a (very) link:https://www.supermemo.com/fr/articles/history[long summary] of the history of SuperMemo. The short version is probably too terse to really understand the improvements, and the long version is probably too detailled to understand everything. (It took me more than 5 hours to read it but it was worth the reading!)

From a high-level perspective, the main motivation for every version is to determine better optimal intervals (= the ideal period of time between separate review of a single card) so that the forgetting index is close to 10% (= recall of 90% is acceptable).

From a low-level perspective, several approaches was experimented by SuperMemo. The first major version (SM-2) introduced the ease factor to capture the difficulty of an item (the lower the ease factor = the more difficult to learn = the shorter the interval). The ease factor was multiplied by the previous interval to determine the next interval. The successive iterations become more and more elaborate:

* By adding new dimensions, in particular what is called by SuperMemo the link:https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Two_component_model_of_memory[two-component model]: stability and retrievability. Stability tells you how long a piece of knowledge can last in memory. Retrievability tells you how easy it is to recall a piece of knowledge. Both notions may appear similar but they aren't. "If you take two memories right after a review, one with a short optimum interval, and the other with a long optimum interval, the memory status of the two must differ," declares Piotr Wozniak, the original author of SuperMemo, "Both can be recalled perfectly (maximum retrievability) and they also need to differ in how long they can last in memory (different stability)." +
The two-component model of long-term memory still represents the foundation of SuperMemo since its introduction in SM-4 in 1989 (the implementation was not successful but the idea remains).

The card interval increases using the following steps: 4 hours, 12 hours, 24 hours, 6 days, 12 days, 48 days, 96 days, and 6 months. Any wrong answer moved back the card to the first interval.

The first implementation simply repeat all the questions you got wrong. The second implementation is similar to Anki where the card interval increases by approximatively 2.2 and wrong answer reset the interval to one day. The next implementation relies on machine learning and use the millions of answers to determine for example the recall probability, which is the chance you answer the wrong answers. This allows for example to reduce the interval for words with irregular spellings when learning a foreign language.

Duolingo has millions of students who generate billions of statistics about language learning every day. Like Quizlet, Duolingo uses machine learning to predict how likely you are to remember any given word at any time. This is represented by the strength meter (still strong, pretty good, time to practice, overdue) below every lesson.

== A Last Word

In my opinion, there is no need to focus too much on optimizing the SRS algorithm. Taking time to design your own effective flashcards is crucial. Making reviewing flashcards an habit and sticking to it has, for sure, a greater impact that the marginal gain to not show the cards more or less often.

Encoding plays a major role. Writing your own flashcards helps to remember them. Designing great flashcards is tough but a poor encoding process will make the best SRS algorithm useless.

Low motivation or the urge of immediate satifaction will always fail any attempt to learn using flashcards. No algorithm can solve this problem.


[NOTE.remember]
.To Remember
====
* *A Spaced Repetition System (SRS) can be implemented without a computer*. The Leitner system remains popular.
* *SRS* target a retention close to 90% (where 10% of cards are wrongly answered).
* *SuperMemo* introduced the first *SRS algorithm running on a computer* (SM-2).
* *SM-2* continues to be used by most applications like Anki.
* *Anki makes the SM-2 highly configurable* and uses different queues to manage cards differently based if their are new, in learning, or simply in review.
* *Most algorithms use the item difficulty* (known as the ease factor) to determine optimal intervals. SuperMemo goes well beyond add uses new dimensions.
* *Recent SRS applications relies on machine learning* to exploit the specificities of the learning materials (ex: English words with irregular syntax) and to use the information collected from their massive dataset of users to tune their algorithm. SuperMemo never chose this approach even if anticipated two decades before.
* *The perfect SRS algorithm will never exist*. No algorithm can determine if you are passionate about a subjet, or if you review inadvertently the content of a card at work during a discussion with a colleage (in which case an "ideal" algorithm must postpone the next review).
* *Devoting time to create great flashcards and strengthen the encoding process* and making reviewing flashcards an habit have probably a far bigger impact than any improvemement in the SRS algorithm you use.

////

It differentiates between how stable knowledge is in long term memory storage, and how easy it is to retrieve.





[When the program schedules the next repetition in 365 days, and the fact is recalled by chance at an earlier time, SuperMemo has no way of knowing about the accidental recollection and will execute the repetition at the previously planned moment. This is not optimal, but it cannot be remedied by improving the algorithm.]





https://www.supermemo.com/fr/articles/history

Shortly after the first SuperMemo program had been implemented, I noticed that E-Factors should not fall below the value of 1.3. Items having E-Factors lower than 1.3 were repeated annoyingly often and always seemed to have inherent flaws in their formulation (usually they did not conform to the minimum information principle). Thus not letting E-Factors fall below 1.3 substantially improved the throughput of the process and provided an indicator of items that should be reformulated.


For the purpose of the SM-17 algorithm we have defined the three components of memory as follows:

* Memory Stability (S) is defined as the inter-repetition interval that produces average recall probability of 0.9 at review time
* Memory Retrievability (R) is defined as the expected probability of recall at any time on the assumption of negatively exponential forgetting of homogenous learning material with the decay constant determined by memory stability (S)
* Item Difficulty (D) is defined as the maximum possible increase in memory stability (S) at review mapped linearly into 0..1 interval with 0 standing for easiest possible items, and 1 standing for highest difficulty in consideration in SuperMemo (the cut off limit currently stands at stability increase 6x less than the maximum possible)





* in the paper-and-pencil version of SuperMemo (1985), C 2 was indeed (almost) a constant. Set at the average of 1.75 (varying from 1.5 to 2.0 for rounding errors and simplicity), it did not consider material difficulty, stability or retrievability of memories, etc.
* in early versions of SuperMemo for DOS (1987), C 2, named E-Factor, reflected item difficulty for the first time. It was decreased for bad grades and increased for good grades
* SuperMemo 4 (1989) did not use C 2, but, to compute inter-repetition intervals, it employed optimization matrices for the first time
* in SuperMemo 5 (1990), C 2, named O-Factor was finally represented as a matrix and it included both the difficulty dimension as well as the stability dimension. Again, entries of the matrix would be subject to the measure-verify-correct cycle that would, starting with the initial value based on prior measurements, produce a convergence towards the value that would satisfy the learning criteria
* in SuperMemo 6 (1991), C 2, in the form of the O-Factor matrix would be derived from a three-dimensional matrix that would include the retrievability dimension. The important implication of the third dimension was that, for the first time, SuperMemo would make it possible to inspect forgetting curves for different levels of difficulty and memory stability
* in SuperMemo 8 (1997) through SuperMemo 16, the representation of C 2 would not change much, however, the algorithm used to produce a quick and stable transition from the theoretical to the real set of data would gradually get more and more complex. Most importantly, new SuperMemos make a better use of the retrievability dimension of C 2. Thus, independent of the spacing effect, the student can depart from the initial learning criteria, e.g. to cram before an exam, without introducing noise into the optimization procedure
* in SuperMemo 17 (2016), C 2 finally took the form based on the original two-component model. It is taken from stability increase matrix (SInc) that has three dimensions that represent the three variables that determine the increase in stability: complexity, stability and retrievability. The SInc matrix is filled up with data during learning using a complex algorithm known as Algorithm SM-17.

SuperMemo 2 was great. Its simple algorithm has survived in various mutations to this day in popular apps such as Anki or Mnemosyne. However, the algorithm was dumb in the sense that there was no way of modifying the function of optimum intervals. The findings of 1985 were set in stone. Memory complexity and stability increase were expressed by the same single number: E-factor. It is a bit like using a single lever in a bike to change gears and the direction of driving.

image::SM-5-Matrix_of_optimum_intervals_in_SuperMemo_5.jpeg[]

Matrix of optimal intervals showed up in SuperMemo 4 in 1989 and survived to this day in SuperMemo 17 with few changes. Matrix of optimum intervals is no longer used in Algorithm SM-17. The values are not set in stone. SuperMemo updates the matrix entries after each answer. The interval function really becomes adaptable.

Algorithm SM-5
SuperMemo uses a simple principle: "use, verify, and correct". After a repetition, a new interval is computed with the help of the OF matrix. The "relevant entry" to compute the interval depends on the repetition (category) and item difficulty. After the interval elapses, SuperMemo calls for the next repetition. The grade is used to tell SuperMemo how well the interval "performed". If the grade is low, we have reasons to believe that the interval is too long and the OF matrix entry is too high. In such cases, we slightly reduce the OF entry. The relevant entry here is the one that was previously used in computing the interval (i.e. before the interval started). In other words, it is the entry that is (1) used to compute the interval (after n-th repetition) and then (2) used to correct the OF matrix (after the n+1 repetition).

In addition, Matrix smoothing is used to modify the neighboring entries. Indeed, if an optimal factor increases or decreases then we could conclude that the OF factor that corresponds to the higher repetition number should also increase.

1991: Employing forgetting curves:

At that time, I was still bound to 360 kB diskettes. For that reason, SuperMemo still could not keep all repetition histories that would fully replicate the 1985 approach on a massive scale. However, on Jan 6, 1990, I had a simple idea. I could just collect data about the forgetting curves for classes of items of different difficulty and stability. Instead of the full record, I would only update the approximation of how many items in a given class are retained in memory at a given time (i.e. at a given level of retrievability). That idea survives at the core of SuperMemo to this day. Even with the full record of repetition histories today, SuperMemo still instantly knows the expected retrievability of items in a given class.


image::supermemo-forgetting-curve.jpeg[]

The forgetting curve is determine for every lapse/repetition combinaison. The optimum interval (7 days on this example) is determined by the intersection with the requested forgetting index (ex: 90% = draw a horiozontal line and check the number of days on the x axis)


 What SuperMemo does is a search for intervals at which items of given difficulty are likely to show a given probability of forgetting (e.g. 10%).


 There have not been any breakthrough improvement to the algorithm since 1991. Can SuperMemo then be yet better, faster, more effective? Wozniak is pessimistic.



Here is how I would explain the entire Algorithm SM-17 using the building blocks of history as written for this article:

* the key to long-term retention is to compute optimum spacing (1985)
* as spacing depends on memory complexity, we need to begin with classifying items into difficulty categories (1987)
* we find the optimum review time by plotting the forgetting curve, which indicates a moment when retention drops below an acceptable level (1991)
* to find optimum time in scarce data, we need to use approximations, and it helps to know that forgetting is exponential (1994)
* as the speed of forgetting depends on memory stability, the whole algorithm must be designed with two component of memory at its core (1988). The lack of consideration for the model may be the chief mistake made by developers of competitive spaced repetition algorithms, e.g. as in the case of neural network approach (1997)
* the key power of the two components model is to make it possible to compute the increase in memory stability at review (2005)
* the algorithm must build the model of memory by collecting repetition data. It must be adaptable to the available information (1989)
* before data is available, it is helpful to start with a universal memory formula (1990)
* further minor adjustments and improvements can make a world of difference (1995), e.g. post-lapse interval, absolute difficulty, fast multi-dimensional regression, etc.

And so, step by step, Algorithm SM-17 has emerged at the top of the evolutionary tree in spaced repetition.



SuperMemo abandoned the SM-2 algorithm in 1989, however, it keeps popping up in new applications with a frequency that must be approaching a few new developments each month. I lost count long ago.

Anki introduced a great deal of innovations into their algorithm but refused to advance beyond its basic principles


The Leitner box is not a spaced repetition tool. It is a prioritization tool. There is no concept of an interval, let alone optimum interval. The name box comes from the original implementation in the form of physical flashcard boxes with not association to passing time. When the Leitner box is used regularly on a small-sized collection of flashcards, it simulates the behavior of spaced repetition. If intervals are too short, it leads to cramming. If they get too long, it leads to sub-optimum outcomes.
Newer software mutations of the Leitner box system may attach intervals to priority boxes. But for the modern Leitner system to be considered a true SRS system, we would need a lot more boxes to have longer and longer intervals between reviews.



https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary

* **A-Factor** (absolute factor; AF): number associated with every element in a collection. A-Factor determines how much intervals increase in the learning process. The higher the A-Factor, the faster the intervals increase. A-Factors reflect item difficulty. The higher the A-Factor the easier the item. The most difficult items have A-Factors equal to 1.2. A-Factor is defined as the quotient of the second optimum interval and the first optimum interval used in repetitions.

* **D-Factor** decline of O-Factors with successive repetitions can be approximated with a power curve that begins at O-Factor that equals A-Factor. D-Factors are no longer used in SuperMemo Algorithm. When a power regression is used to compute O-Factors on the basis of R-Factors for successive repetitions in a single A-Factor category, the decay constant of the resulting function is called a D-Factor. The larger the D-Factor the faster the decline of O-Factors with each repetition. This means that large D-Factors imply more frequent repetitions. D in D-Factor stands for decay (it is a decay constant of the negative power function).

* **E-Factor** (easiness factor; EF) is the number related to the difficulty of a given element in early versions of SuperMemo (up to and including SuperMemo 7). New inter-repetition intervals were determined by multiplying the old interval by E-Factor.

* **matrix smoothing** is a mathematical procedure that converts a matrix of numbers into a "smoother version" (e.g. by averaging the neighboring entries). For example, if the row of the matrix is 1, 2, 3, 4, 666, 6, 7, 8, smoothing might convert it to 1, 2, 3, 6, 99, 9, 8.

* **O-Factor** (optimum factor; OF) is a number which tells you how much intervals should increase to reach recall of 90%. O-Factors differ for different levels of memory stability and different item difficulty. They are normalized for the forgetting index of 10%. For the first repetition, i.e. there was no prior interval, O-Factor is assumed to be the same as the first interval (as if the prior interval was 1 day). For the first repetition, different O-Factors are computed for a different number of memory lapses. For example: if the O-Factor is 2.5, and the prior interval was 20 days, at repetition time, the new interval should be set to 2.5*20 days, i.e. 50 days.

* **OF matrix** is athe matrix of O-Factors for different levels of difficulty (expressed as A-Factor) and stability (expressed as repetition category). The OF matrix is used by SuperMemo Algorithms SM-5 through SM-15 in computing optimum intervals in spaced repetition. In the newest algorithms, the role of the 2-dimensional OF matrix is played by the 3-dimensional SInc[] matrix (with the added dimension of retrievability).

* **R-Factor** (retention factor; RF) is the number which says at which U-Factor (i.e. the measure of interval increase) the measured forgetting index (i.e. the measure of forgetting) is approximated to be 10%. This number is unique for different item difficulties and for different repetition categories (i.e. the measure of memory stability). R-Factors can be seen as a vertical green line on forgetting curve graphs in SuperMemo.

* **U-Factor** is the number associated with each memorized element. It equals to the ratio of the current interval and the previously used interval. If the element has not been repeated yet, i.e. the previous interval is not defined, U-Factor equals the first interval. The greater the U-Factor the greater the increase of the interval between repetitions. For items, U-Factors are determined by SuperMemo Algorithm. For topics, U-Factors are determined by A-Factors.

.Anki Terminology
====
**TODO** rephrase https://www.quora.com/In-regards-to-Anki-spaced-repetition-what-are-buried-suspended-cards
**TODO** not sure if all terms are relevant as buried/suspended/siblings are not covered

* **Buried cards**: Buried cards don’t get shown. However at the start of every day every buried card get’s unburied.

* **Suspended card**: Like burried cards, suspended cards don’t get shown. However they don’t get automatically unsuspended. To unsuspend a card you have to go to the card browser. Suspended cards have a yellow background in the card browser.

* **Sibling cards**: All cards create by the same note are siblings. If you have a Note Type for learning German vocabulary the “Baum->tree” card and the “tree->Baum” card are siblings if they are created by the same note. +
When you answer a card, all it’s siblings automatically get buried. This means that you won’t see the “Baum->tree”-card and the “tree->Baum” card on the same day.

* **Leeches**: If a card get’s rated wrong at 8 separate days, it get’s tagged as a leech. The numbers of days can be changed in the settings.

"Recent" years have seen many applications relying on SRS appearing in popular app stores: link:https://quizlet.com/[Quizlet], link:https://www.memrise.com/[Memrise], link:https://www.duolingo.com/[Duolingo], link:https://www.lingodeer.com/[LingoDeer], link:https://www.brainscape.com/[Brainscape], link:https://lingvist.com/[Lingvist], link:https://chegg.com[Chegg], link:https://www.remnote.com/[RemNote], link:https://mochi.cards/[Mochi], link:https://www.memcode.com/[Memcode], ...

* link:https://mochi.cards/docs/#spaced-repetition[__Mochi__'s algorithm] is very simple. The card interval is doubled after correct answer, and cut in half otherwise.

* link:https://memrise.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360015889057-How-does-the-spaced-repetition-system-work-[__Memrise__'s algorithm] is similar to _Mochi_'s. The card interval increases using the following steps: 4 hours, 12 hours, 24 hours, 6 days, 12 days, 48 days, 96 days, and 6 months. Any wrong answer moved back the card to the first interval.

* link:https://quizlet.com/blog/spaced-repetition-for-all-cognitive-science-meets-big-data-in-a-procrastinating-world[Quizlet's algorithm] has known several iterations. The first implementation simply repeat all the questions you got wrong. The second implementation is similar to Anki where the card interval increases by approximatively 2.2 and wrong answer reset the interval to one day. The next implementation relies on machine learning and use the millions of answers to determine for example the recall probability, which is the chance you answer the wrong answers. This allows for example to reduce the interval for words with irregular spellings when learning a foreign language.

* link:https://blog.duolingo.com/how-we-learn-how-you-learn/[__Duolingo__'s algorithm] is similar to Quizlet. Duolingo has millions of students who generate billions of statistics about language learning every day. Like Quizlet, Duolingo uses machine learning to predict how likely you are to remember any given word at any time. This is represented by the strength meter (still strong, pretty good, time to practice, overdue) below every lesson.

== A Last Word

In my opinion, there is no need to focus too much on optimizing the SRS algorithm. Taking time to design your own effective flashcards is crucial. Making reviewing flashcards an habit and sticking to it has, for sure, a greater impact that the marginal gain to not show the cards more or less often.

Encoding plays a major role. Writing your own flashcards helps to remember them. Designing great flashcards is tough but a poor encoding process will make the best SRS algorithm useless.

Low motivation or the urge of immediate satifaction will always fail any attempt to learn using flashcards. No algorithm can solve this problem.

### SRS Applications


[quote, Mochi Documentation]
____
link:https://mochi.cards/docs/#spaced-repetition[Mochi's algorithm] is very simple. Each time you remember a card, the time it takes before it's reviewed again doubles. When a card is forgotten that time is cut in half. These settings can be tweaked in the settings, and different decks can have their own settings.
____

[quote, Mochi Documentation]
link:https://mochi.cards/faq.html[Which spaced repetition algorithim does Mochi use?]
Mochi uses a modified SM-2 algorithim. Modified in that 1. the easing factor must be adjusted by the user manually and 2. cards do not reset their repetition interval on an incorrect answer by default."

The link:https://memrise.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360015889057-How-does-the-spaced-repetition-system-work-[Memrise algorithm] predicts when any given word or sentence is likely to fall out of your long-term memory and it's time for you to review it. This is based on a learning technique called the spaced repetition system, which leads to stronger memories.

When reviewing a word or sentence correctly, the item will be moved to a longer interval. The review schedule is as follows:

Next review in: 4 hours > 12 hours > 24 hours > 6 days > 12 days > 48 days > 96 days > 6 months

If you get an item wrong during a review, it will be moved back to the first interval (i.e. to be reviewed in 4 hours).

[quote, Quizlet Documentation]
____
Long-Term Learning used a standard spaced repetition algorithm, similar to SuperMemo or Anki. It works something like this:

* Introduce a few new terms each day
* Study all of the day’s terms until you get them all correct, then study the new terms again the next day
* Each time a term is answered correctly, increase the delay until it’s studied again by a little * more than double (Study 1 day later, 3 days after that, then 7 days, 16 days, etc.)
* If a term is answered incorrectly, start over and reset the delay for that term to 1 day.

image::anki-deck-options-scheduling.png[]

See `anki/ftl/core/deck-config.ftl`

* Daily Limits
** New cards/day: `value` (default `20`)
*** ℹ: The maximum number of new cards to introduce in a day, if new cards are available. Because new material will increase your short-term review workload, this should typically be at least 10x smaller than your review limit.
*** **TODO**
** Maximum reviews/day: `value` (default `50`)
*** ℹ: The maximum number of review cards to show in a day, if cards are ready for review.
*** **TODO**

* New Cards
** Learning steps (default `1m 10m`)
*** ℹ: One or more delays, separated by spaces. The first delay will be used when you press the `Again` button on a new card, and is 1 minute by default. The `Good` button will advance to the next step, which is 10 minutes by default. Once all steps have been passed, the card will become a review card, and will appear on a different day. Delays are typically minutes (eg `1m`) or days (eg `2d`), but hours (eg `1h`) and seconds (eg `30s`) are also supported.
*** **TODO**
** Graduating interval (default `1`)
*** ℹ: The number of days to wait before showing a card again, after the `Good` button is pressed on the final learning step.
*** **TODO**
** Easy interval (default `4`)
*** ℹ: The number of days to wait before showing a card again, after the `Easy` button is used to immediately remove a card from learning.
*** **TODO**
** Insertion order: `Sequential`, `Random` (default `???`)
*** ℹ: Controls the position (due #) new cards are assigned when you add new cards. Cards with a lower due number will be shown first when studying. Changing this option will automatically update the existing position of new cards.
*** **TODO**

* Lapses
** Relearning steps (default `10m`)
*** ℹ: Zero or more delays, separated by spaces. By default, pressing the `Again` button on a review card will show it again 10 minutes later. If no delays are provided, the card will have its interval changed, without entering relearning.
*** **TODO**
** Minimum interval (default `1`)
*** ℹ: The minimum interval given to a review card after answering `Again`.
*** **TODO**
** Leech threshold (default `8`)
*** ℹ: The number of times `Again` needs to be pressed on a review card before it is marked as a leech. Leeches are cards that consume a lot of your time, and when a card is marked as a leech, it's a good idea to rewrite it, delete it, or think of a mnemonic to help you remember it.
*** **TODO**
** Leech action: "Suspend Card" (default) or "Tag Only"
*** ℹ: `Tag Only`: Add a "leech" tag to the note, and display a pop-up. `Suspend Card`: In addition to tagging the note, hide the card until it is manually unsuspended.
*** **TODO**

* Timer
** Maximum answer seconds (default `60`)
*** ℹ: The maximum number of seconds to record for a single review. If an answer exceeds this time (because you stepped away from the screen for example), the time taken will be recorded as the limit you have set.
*** **TODO**
** Show answer time: on/off (default off)
*** ℹ: In the review screen, show a timer that counts the number of seconds you're taking to review each card.
*** **TODO**

* Burying
** Bury new siblings until the next day: on/off (default on)
*** ℹ: Whether other cards of the same note (eg reverse cards, adjacent cloze deletions) will be delayed until the next day.
*** **TODO**
** Bury review siblings until the next day: on/off (default on)
*** ℹ: Whether other cards of the same note (eg reverse cards, adjacent cloze deletions) will be delayed until the next day.
*** **TODO**

* Audio
** Don't play audio automatically: on/off (default off)
*** **TODO**
** Skip question when replaying answer: on/off (default off)
*** ℹ: Whether the question audio should be included when the Replay action is used while looking at the answer side of a card.
*** **TODO**

* Advanced
** Maximum interval (default `36500`)
*** ℹ: The maximum number of days a review card will wait. When reviews have reached the limit, `Hard`, `Good` and `Easy` will all give the same delay. The shorter you set this, the greater your workload will be.
*** **TODO**
** Starting ease  (default `2.50`)
*** ℹ: The ease multiplier new cards start with. By default, the `Good` button on a newly-learned card will delay the next review by 2.5x the previous delay.
*** **TODO**
** Easy bonus  (default `1.30`)
*** ℹ: An extra multiplier that is applied to a review card's interval when you rate it `Easy`.
*** **TODO**
** Interval modifier (default `1.00`)
*** ℹ: This multiplier is applied to all reviews, and minor adjustments can be used to make Anki more conservative or aggressive in its scheduling. Please see the manual before changing this option.
*** **TODO**
** Hard interval (default `1.20`)
*** ℹ: The multiplier applied to a review interval when answering `Hard`.
*** **TODO**
** New interval  (default `0.00`)
*** ℹ: The multiplier applied to a review interval when answering `Again`.
*** **TODO**

## Limitations
# * Only works with a single deck. Anki tries to read cards that must review for every deck. We ignore this logic as it's not related to the SRS Algorithm
# * Anki run SQL queries to update or retrieve cards. We will work for a in-memory list of cards instead and use common functions (filter, sort, etc.)
# * Anki SRS queues are populated by card id. We will store cards directly as they are already in memory.
# * Only Basic notes are supported. Burying siblings is no possible and not implemented here.
# * Consider days end at midnight (Anki supports a collection setting "Next day starts at `4` hours past midnight"


## FAQ
##
## Why new/review queues?
# Successive failures while cards are in learning do not result in further decreases to the card’s ease. A common complaint with the standard SM-2 algorithm is that repeated failings of a card cause the card to get stuck in "low interval hell". In Anki, the initial acquisition process does not influence a card’s ease.
# See https://faqs.ankiweb.net/what-spaced-repetition-algorithm.html#review-cards
##
##
## What about buried?
# Only new/review cards are buried when a card of the same note is answered (card in learning are not concerned)
# See https://docs.ankiweb.net/studying.html#siblings-and-burying
##
##
## In which order Anki shows cards?
## By default, Anki brings up your daily cards in this order:
## 1. learning cards that are due
## 2. (optional) new cards if your preferences are set to have them first
## 3. review cards
## 4. "day learning" cards, which are cards in the learning queue that crossed from one day to the next without graduating to the review queue.
## 5. (optional) new cards if your preferences put them last
## See https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1807121582
##
##
## Why new cards have no ease?
## New cards have no ease, so no matter how many times you press 'Again' or 'Hard',
## the future ease factor of the card won't be affected.
## The same can be said about relearning cards: pressing 'Again' or 'Hard' won't have
## any effect over the card's ease.
##
##
## Day Boundaries (sub-day vs day learning queues)
##
## Anki treats small steps and steps that cross a day boundary differently. With small steps, the cards are shown as soon as the delay has passed, in preference to other waiting cards like reviews. This is done so that you can answer the card as closely to your requested delay as possible. In contrast, if the interval crosses a day boundary, it is automatically converted to days.
## See https://docs.ankiweb.net/deck-options.html?#day-boundaries
