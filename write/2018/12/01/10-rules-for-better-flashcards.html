<p>I use flashcards a lot. To learn English vocabulary, the grammar, new programming languages, technical jargon, useful commands, and so much more. If I want to retrieve something from memory without going through a Google search, flashcards are my secret weapon since many years. Until now, I created thousands of flashcards manually and even more <a href="/write/2016/12/26/anki-scripting.html">programmatically</a>. While flashcards are simple to create (just a note with a question on the front and the answer on the back), creating effective flashcards may not be obvious at first. By following the rules present in this article, you will avoid most of the errors I made.</p>

<p>Creating flashcards take time, a lot of time. As a consequence, I am often reluctant to add too many flashcards because it&#8217;s just not funny to create them. At the beginning, I was copying whole blocks of text based on books, sometimes even screenshots. It was an easy way to push a lot of content to review. These flashcards are no longer existing in my decks. I have deleted and/or refactored all of them, without any exception.</p>

<p>Programs are written in languages that have precise grammar rules, like in English. This flashcard illustrates different syntaxes, some valid and others invalid.

<p>This flashcard is based on a quiz present in a certification book and has many flaws:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>As it tests different syntax rules, there is not a single answer. You can be right for the first option and wrong for the two last options. A good flashcard should have a unique valid answer. You can&#8217;t be partially right or partially wrong.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Consequently, you will need to revise the whole flashcards even if you already know the answer for most of the options, losing precious seconds that can be devoted to more tricky flashcards.</p>

<p><span class="flashcard-advantage">Advantage</span>: By splitting into multiple flashcards, you learn each underlying rule at a different pace (on this example, the 3rd rule is the harder and take more time to assimilate). In this way, you don&#8217;t have to review already assimilated cards, and for each flashcard, either you know the answer or you don&#8217;t. It&#8217;s obvious to say if the flashcard was easy or hard.</p>

<p>Git is a program that keep the history of changes you do in a set of files. Programmers use it to keep the history of changes for the source code of a program. After each update, each developer pushes his modifications. Git makes sure there aren&#8217;t two developers who have changed the same code, and records a new commit, a kind of number to identify the changes. Developers can restore a previous state at any time by specifying an old commit.</p>

<p>The problem with verbose back card is there is too much information to be able to say with confidence how easy it was to recall. Some of the information is harder to remember, and some of the information does not even deserve to be remembered. The solution is to follow the previous rule <em>More is better than less</em>, and split the flashcard into many smaller ones (and also delete the original flashcard, even if it took you a lot of time to create it initially).</p>

<h2 id="two_way_is_better_than_one_way">Two-way is better than one-way</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Creating a single flashcard is rarely enough. Learning is more complex. For example, the <a href="https://www.montessoriservices.com/ideas-insights/the-three-period-lesson">three-period lesson</a>, a hallmark of Montessori education, was devised by the French physician Edouard Seguin, and helps young children learn vocabulary and concepts, following 3 steps:</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p><strong>Naming</strong> (Introduction) "This is a dog.",</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Recognizing</strong> (Identification) "Show me the dog."</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Remembering</strong> (Cognition) "What is this?"</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>All 3 steps are important, otherwise you can learn to recognize the dog, but fail to name it when you see it. You have to learn two related but different things. Flashcards are particularly well adapted to this system. For example, Anki can create for you a reversed card to be sure you learn the information in both ways. This model is very useful when learning foreign vocabulary. For example, you may want to recognize the word <em>voiture</em> in French texts and be able to translate the English word <em>car</em> when speaking French.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When it comes to determine the right number of flashcards to create, context is everything. Sometimes, one flashcard is enough, and sometimes, more than two flashcards are necessary. For example, if you want to read some French books, you can create only flashcards with French words on the front and English translations at the back, but if you want to speak French during your next trip to Paris, you better have to create flashcards with English words (or pictures) on the front, and French translations at the back.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In practice, starting with the right number of flashcards is far from easy. I&#8217;m still failing. When this happens, I recognize my failure and I update my deck to add new flashcards and/or deleting existing ones. Learning is an iterative process.</p>

<p>A good way to make flashcards more specific is to use cloze deletions. Cloze deletion is the process of hiding one or more words in a sentence. These flashcards are sometimes called fill-in-the-blank flashcards.</p>

<h3 id="example_5">Example</h3>

Otherwise, if you only create flashcards for exceptions, you will learn to recognize these flashcards and be able to answer correctly without paying notice to the question ("Oh yes, I remember some words don&#8217;t have a plural form, the answer is <em>No</em>").

<h2 id="mixed_is_better_than_to_much_organized">Mixed is better than (to much) organized</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Flashcards should be organized. You cannot just put every flashcard on a big box and revise them together. You probably don&#8217;t want to chain "How to say hello in French?", "What is the Linux command to check available disk space?", "What is the capital of Japan?". Even if our brain is organized as a giant network of interconnected neurons, sometimes, a little organization is welcome. Anki lets you group your flashcards in several decks to revise them independently (French, Geography, Capitals). But too much separation is not necessarily a good thing to me:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>It&#8217;s hard a review a large number of decks each day. You will not have new cards every day for each deck, and as soon as a deck fails to get new cards to learn, it loses some interest (learning is funnier than revising).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Our brain has a wonderful aptitude to bring together unrelated information to create new ideas. Reviewing each subject separately go against it and by doing so, you lose one of the main benefits of flashcards. There are, however, subjects that are best kept separated. If you aspire to become a polyglot, I&#8217;m not sure mixing vocabulary for French, Italian, Spanish, Chinese, Danish will be profitable (but I may be wrong). This can create confusion and slows down your progression. On the contrary, interspersing Unix, Git, Emacs, VS Code commands will help you see the similarities (e.g., Bash uses Emacs shortcuts, Git follow X-Style for arguments, etc.). You will not just learn facts, you will understand the rules behind them.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In practice, I limit myself to a few decks whose name should be very general: <em>English</em> for everything about the English language, <em>Programming</em> for everything related to my job of developer, even if that&#8217;s not code, <em>General</em> for everything else such as capitals, history, geography. But If you are enthusiast about history and create a lot of flashcards about it, you will probably need a deck only for history. In short, it depends.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p><span class="flashcard-advantage">Advantage</span>: Group flashcards according their topic and not their type. When you speak English, you need to know the grammar, some vocabulary, and maybe a few idioms. Everything is related and that should be reflected into your decks. Organize the information in the same way that you are using it (when programming, you are editing some code in your text editor using shortcuts, you are committing your changes using Git commands from a Linux terminal).</p>

<p>School often forces us to learn foreign vocabulary by topic. Most vocabulary books and online lessons are also organized like that. But should we learn all the vegetables before the means of transportation? Or the reverse? I would like to see you get off the plane at Paris airport, knowing how to say cucumber in French, but not knowing how to ask for help or a taxi. In the same way, I&#8217;m not sure knowing how to say a horse carriage in French will be useful to decipher the main ingredients on a French menu at a local restaurant.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>An alternative that I have found more effective in practice is to learn the vocabulary according their frequency. There exist frequency dictionaries published as books or available online. This way, you will quickly know about car, bus, train, salad, carrot, and only after you have mastered the basic vocabulary, you will heard about hoverboard, turnip, etc.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This applies not just for vocabulary. You probably don&#8217;t want to learn all the vocabulary before learning the grammar, and only then the slangs and idioms. Or you don&#8217;t want to learn all Git commands before learning all Linux commands, and only then the shortcuts of your favorite text editor. Mixing up is more appropriate. Learn the basic Git commands, the basic Linux commands, the most useful shortcuts. Then, learn advanced Git commands, less widespread Linux options, etc.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In practice, I make sure to add flashcards at the appropriate time. I added the first thousand most common English words, and only after, the next thousand words, and so on. I added the most Git useful commands after reading an introductory book, and only after, I completed the list by reading a more authoritative book on the subject.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p><span class="flashcard-advantage">Advantage</span>: As said before, our brain is not a perfectly organized warehouse but a giant mess of interconnected neurons.

<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As said before, creating flashcards is not the most rewarding task. It sucks even when you knows the efficiency of flashcards. So, why not using shared flashcard collections. Anki offers <a href="https://ankiweb.net/shared/decks/">shared decks</a>, and there are numerous applications that was created the last years based on the spaced repetition system. For example, you can learn vocabulary with Memrise, and the grammar with Duolingo.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>On the Internet, you will find numerous discussions about using those specialized (and often subscription-based) apps over using generalized applications like Anki. Personally, I tried these applications some years ago. I was using Memrise a lot at first, until I finally choose the centralized approach of using only one application, Anki. The reasons are numerous:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Learning is too crucial to depend on proprietary applications, which need viable business plans to subsist (a flashcard required several years to be really assimilated, I don&#8217;t want to reprocess the same cards tomorrow with another application). Using an OSS solution like Anki get you full control of your data. I wrote a <a href="/write/2016/12/26/anki-scripting.html">blog post</a> about how to export them in HTML just for the demo. Besides, with Anki, all your data resides on your disk. Ankiweb is used to synchronise them between your different devices (a small inconvenience compared to cloud based products that synchronize everything transparently).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As outlined in the rule <em>Random is better than linear</em>, you may want to learn the French vocabulary during the same review session as the French grammar. Using specialized apps, you have to switch between different applications. Making an habit is hard enough to not throw to many applications at it. Furthermore, there isn&#8217;t an existing application for everything you want to learn&#8230;&#8203;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>With Anki, I decide what I really want and need to learn. When using Memrise, you are limited to existing collections (e.g., 4000 words for an educated vocabulary, 500 most common words) What if you want to learn the 5000 most frequent words? You don&#8217;t control what you really learn, and this is, in my opinion, unacceptable (despite I found these apps very great with their clean interface and rich user experience).</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Nevertheless, some subjects like vocabulary makes good candidates for sharing (look at Anki shared decks, the majority concerns foreign languages). Use them with caution to get started or if you have no plan to get really far in this particular language. Otherwise, adapt them to fit your own workflow (change the flashcard style, import them into the same deck, complete them with new cards, etc).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><span class="flashcard-advantage">Advantage</span>: Creating custom flashcards is the best way to stay in control of what you learn. The only downside is it requires time, a lot of time, but remember we lay the first stone of learning when we are creating them in the first place.</p>
