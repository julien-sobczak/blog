<p>Life is a journey.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>The first step of our journey leads us to the city of learning. Like any tourist, our goal is to visit the most beautiful places and come back with great memories.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As time is precious, a little preparation is always a good idea. At our arrival, we make a detour to the tourist information office and grab a map of the city:</p>

<p>Let’s get started!</p>

<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="the_travel_guidebook">The Travel Guidebook</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Before a journey, many tourists buy a city guide, available in any bookshop or library. These books contain all the “incontournable” places&#8212;&#8203;shops, museums, restaurants, and so much more. To get the most of your time, travel guides include predefined itineraries to make sure you do not miss anything.</p>

</div>
<div class="title">Figure 2. Example of a predefined itinerary</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>My wife and I are big fans of these itineraries during our first days. I’m also a huge fan of Google Maps and Google Street View (I consider myself a virtual globetrotter, better than couchsurfing since I’m using my own couch). I spent a lot of time preparing our vacations online, but once there, I’m not very reliable and it’s not uncommon for us to end in unexpected places. But that’s a good thing.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Imagine if every traveller were following the same guide at the same time. We would walk along each other on the sidewalk, and wait in line to visit popular attractions at the same time. Clearly not the best travel experience. Instead, travellers are spreaded naturally all around the city, admiring the monuments, and following their own interests to determine the next street to visit. That’s what travelling is and that’s what learning must look like too.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Indeed, we all have different backgrounds. We haven’t studied at the same university. We often haven’t even studied the same courses. Some of us are just joining the professional world, some are starting a new career in a new company, while others are at the same desk for a long time. That is called diversity, and provided that diversity is inclusive, which means we all have enough bagages in common to understand each other, that’s a very nice environment in which to progress and innovate.<sup class="footnote">[<a id="_footnoteref_1" class="footnote" href="#_footnotedef_1" title="View footnote.">1</a>]</sup></p>

<p>Diversity is great. You don&#8217;t follow other tourists when visiting a city. You must do the same when learning. You must find your own path. There are clearly overcrowded places that you must visit, but remember innovation always happens when someone decides to travel off the beaten path. Choose what interests you the most at the present time and follow that direction.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Most companies offer their employees the possibility to enroll in training programs. In my previous job, I assume on several occasions the role of training instructor. I must confess that I’m not a big fan of training programs. Writing the support for a new training takes a long time and therefore, for practical reasons, you must optimize the content to satisfy the aspirations of a sufficiently large number of potential trainees. You cannot adventure in a no-man&#8217;s land.</p>

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>During the training session, you are on the passenger seat, observing the main streets, taking pictures of the main landmarks, but you are not really feeling the excitement of the city, which often happens in the back streets.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Trainings are guided tours, like the recommended itineraries in your guide. You will learn a lot, but that’s not the most enjoyable experience.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A few companies go even further, prescribing a list of mandatory training courses their employees must follow to advance their career. That’s nonsense. That’s destructive for innovation. If everyone follows the same path, you must not be surprised that everyone starts thinking similarly. Please, don’t do that. Let employees be the drivers of their career and determine their learning path. Training courses are still useful, as long as your have options.</p>

<p>Learning a new subject is not easy. Sometimes, it is just too hard. As a developer, having basic knowledge in networks is not simply useful, it’s imperative since the majority of programs don’t run in isolation but communicate with the outside world. But things are not so simple. I flunked at university. I flunked at work. Sometimes, the road is too steep.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>What you need is to follow your inner GPS. You are not forced to turn at the next intersection. You may continue straight and find an alternative itinerary that goes to the same point, using a longer road that is considerably less steep than the initial road. Moving towards the destination is the goal. The faster we move, the better. But remember moving at a slow pace is infinitely better than being stuck at the same place. You need to find your own way, which means, once again, you need to learn to appreciate self-guided tours.</p>

<p>Concerning my difficulties about learning networks, I decided to rethink my approach. My previous expositions on the subject all used the same <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/166190.Computer_Networks">bottom-up approach</a>, starting with the lower layers. Therefore:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>I decided to move in the opposite direction, starting with application protocols like HTTP, before <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13661492-computer-networking">moving down the TCP/IP model</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I read several similar books even if they covered the same materials. Sometimes, a little repetition is necessary.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I looked <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/583307.The_Implementation">under the hood of the TCP/IP stack</a> in Linux to face the reality that networking is just code running on servers, and as a developer, there is no reason I can’t make sense of it.</p>

<p>Self-guided tours are preferable concerning learning but this strategy is not always applicable.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you are on the rear of a tandem bicycle, your handlebar is of no use to control the direction. You must be in the driver seat. You must be in control of your learning path, something that is called <em>active learning</em>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you are at school, the teacher is often leading the lecture (<em>passive learning</em>) and there is no easy way out. But if you are reading a book, watching a conference or following a MOOC, you can pause, open the map and find a new itinerary. It may be a beginner book on the subject, a new introductory blog post to read, or simply a good night&#8217;s sleep.</p>

<h2 id="the_gift_of_ubiquity">The Gift of Ubiquity</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Unlike the real-world where you always stand at a well-defined location, learning is different. You can follow different paths at the same time. During your studies, you were taking different courses during the same semester, all on different topics. This is possible because we have the gift of ubiquity when it comes to learning. We can be at multiple locations, following multiple learning paths, and that’s very useful.</p>

<div class="title">Figure 6. The ability to learn multiple subjects in parallel</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Indeed, learning on different subjects is preferable as it increases the time between review sessions, so that we can reflect more on the subject and slowly consolidate what we are learning to make it stick. If we had to focus on only one topic instead, we would feel literally submerged with a flood of new information, and as we know it, cramming is a bad strategy to learn and remember what we learn. The ubiquitousness of learning allows us to move slower, to appreciate the landscape, and enjoy the journey. But that’s not the only advantage.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When following several paths, there are inevitably moments when paths are crossing, when we are making connections among subjects, connecting the dots like neurons are interconnected in our memory. There&#8217;s an old saying in neuroscience: “neurons that fire together wire together.” The more we create connections during learning, the stronger that learning is, and the easier it becomes to apply knowledge from one domain to a different one, which is called <em>transfer of learning</em>.</p>

✔️ <strong>Mastering a subject takes time</strong>. You may be tempted to rush, but the truth is there is an incompressible time for you to reach expertise on any subject.

<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Sometimes, we are not in control of our learning. We are suddenly teleported somewhere else on the map, in a remote location that looks unfamiliar. This happens when you enroll in a training session without having the prerequisites, when a colleague shares with you a new tool that he has discovered recently and you haven’t heard before, or when you must complete a challenging task. These situations are perilous and you must work hard to not stay at this place for too long.</p>
